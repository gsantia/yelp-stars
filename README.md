# Yelp Stars regression project

Ordinal regression in order to predict how many stars a Yelp review
has, based only on textual features. The dataset was provided by Yelp as part of their daily data science contest.

The work is presented in detailed Jupyter notebooks with quite a bit of commentary.
Start with `charts.ipynb`, then move onto `modeling.ipynb`.
