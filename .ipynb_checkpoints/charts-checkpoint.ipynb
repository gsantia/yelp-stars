After dealing with the insurance company to get a total loss claim completed I went to pick up my personal items from inside the car. After grabbing everything, I noticed someone had stolen my USB cable from the car, I told the supervisor who I\\'d been working with this entire time but they just shrugged their sholders and said \"sometimes these things happen, usually I catch them.\" To top it off, I noticed that nothing on my car had been touched where I was hit, even though they had told me they ordered all the parts and had the car almost complete assembled before they noticed the new damage which caused it to be totaled.

I think it's ridiculous that they have to implement the rules that we can't split checks and on top of that we can't have multiple payments?! It makes it stressful on my group and other customer's groups, and it strongly deters people from dining in here. The cashiers sigh and roll their eyes when a group has difficulty arranging the payment method, and I'm just standing in front of them like you guys are just standing and taking payments, no need to roll your eyes when customers are struggling to pay because of your unnecessary rules/ limitations to big groups. Some servers are sweet and I appreciate that but other employee's just don't know how to hold customer service. When we dined in one time, my cousin put her head down because she had a headache and an employee comes up to our table to let us know that she can't be laying her head on the table... why not? We are paying customers clearly waiting for our food, what else should we resort to while sitting down?!

First, the management. They were nice as could be until they had my money, at which point I became useless and they were nonexistent. I\\'ve had numerous problems in the unit since moving in and you practically have to gun them down to get them to fix anything.  Constant fire alarms, pet hair in common areas, flooding in the halls (in a brand new building!) - none of this fazes them as long as more leases are being signed. Second, the construction.  When I moved in, the management casually mentioned they were going to start some additional construction in the fall, but I never expected to lose sleep over it, literally - construction starts at 6:00 AM EVERY DAY (except Sunday) approximately ten feet outside my window ( is this even legal?) and couldn\\'t be louder. Because of this, nearly every day is full of technical issues in my apartment - internet going down constantly (I am typing this in Starbucks because the \"free internet\" has failed yet again), cell phone reception now spotty, DirecTV in and out daily, etc.  In short, DO NOT LIVE HERE.

The sports bar in the back is filled with cliched men literally hooting and hollering at each dramatic turn of the basketball game being aired.  Guy's guys carrying on and enjoying the holy trinity of sports, alcohol, and women.  I definitely felt out of place.  The nightclub was especially theatric with the female bartender climbing the rack above the bar and hanging upside down serving drinks to the largely male clientele.  She even did a number where she hung with her legs suspended and invited men to place their head between her thighs from the backside so she could give them shots individually.

They seemed to be out of a lot of stuff, which seemed odd because it was 11:30 am on a Friday, you would think they would be prepared and stocked with what they offer, everything I wanted to try was unavailable so I had to settle for the \" Al Pastor\". The meat itself was tasteless, it needed salt n seasonings BAD! I was hugely disappointed, my husband had the \"Bombay Taco\" that one was a little more flavorful.

The clerk apologized and said she would upgrade the room for us. I said that\\'s great but we requested a wheelchair accessible room for a reason and the \"upgrade\" room wasn\\'t accessible. So we had to wait around at 2am while housekeeping rushed to get a room read for us. 2) We get to the room and it was rather small but after getting in from such a late flight we didn\\'t care. The next morning I start to unpack our things and the entire closet smells horribly of weed....more on this point later. 3) I turn the water on to brush my teeth and there is no hot water....ok what ever cold water works, right?....Until I run the shower for 20 minutes and still cant get hot water in the room. 2 hours later engineering comes in and replaces our hot water valve and then says oh just let it run it will work now. It took me calling the front desk and engineering multiple times to get someone to come fix our hot water and we have lost half of the day. 4) Leaving we saw housekeeping working on the room next to ours and though \"oh good, they will do ours next\".....we come back early the next day and housekeeping never came. I call my friends at the front desk again very upset about this and they were just like well did you have the do not disturb sign on the door? I said no and not only that we saw them next door to us as we were leaving so there was no reason for them to not clean our room. So they sent up towels and agreed to have the manager call me at 11AM because of how upset I was over our visit. 5) So it is now 11:40 am and no call from the manager. I call the front desk and ask for the manager myself since it was too much for them to call me. I tell her everything once I get a hold of her and she does the same routine of asking if the do not disturb sign was on the door and then offers me an air freshener to get rid of the smell of weed in the closet. Seriously? This is your solution? I paid over $1K for a 4 night stay to be offered a car air freshener to get rid of the smell of weed in our closet? No hot water, no housekeeping, no club writs bands for free entry that is supposed to come with our Mlife membership cause the room that had them was locked. On top of everything I bring up that I was supposed to receive a call at 11AM and the manager tells me that yeah she sees that in the notes.....So the manager was notified to call me but just didn\\'t give enough of a $%&* to follow through. I also had to fight tooth and nail to get them to refund the resort fees. Final Thoughts: I wont be back. We have already booked another week long trip for work and to catch a show in April and MGM Grand just lost that reservation to another hotel.',\n",

I was explained that when bringing in my computer to be repaired that there was an initial $79 fee and then if it was found to be hardware issue that my $79 would go towards the repair ..

I explained to the little man behind the desk how I felt ripped off and how what he said vs what he did were two different things .. He didn't seem to care and when I asked for my information with my passwords back he refused to shred it ... BEWARE !!!!

I called several other rug companies (including ones that specialize in Afghan rugs) and not one of them had ever heard of such a smell. They were all disgusted that rugs would smell that way, and I am disgusted too. My room still smelt like gasoline 40 minutes after removing the rug, even though the rug was only in my room for 5 minutes. When I called to discuss a return, a costumer service representative was very curt and hung up on me. Despite the gasoline smell, I had to pay for return shipping. I also had to reiterate four times that the refund amount they quoted me was $60 less than what I was owed. I eventually did receive my refund.

Cowabunga Bay is really clean, which I appreciate. Food is available for purchase while in the park and the prices are as expected.  Other than that, I think the customer service here is terrible. We visited this afternoon (4/14/17) around 2 o\\'clock and our experience today just put a bad taste in my mouth. First of all, the employee at the ticket booth was completely uninformed and had no idea what she was talking about. Perhaps management should spend more time training their employees so that they can properly answer any question proposed by a guest! Second of all, the female security guard working the entrance today was straight up rude! We brought my nephew\\'s cooler with us and it was filled with the snacks he eats. The female security guard grabbed the bag out of my mom\\'s hands before she could even place it on the table and started emptying it immediately. She was looking at my nephew\\'s snacks saying, \"The baby is not going to eat this!\" Excuse me? How do you know what my nephew does and doesn\\'t eat? That is completely besides the point. The point is, she went about the problem in the wrong manner. Her tone of voice was disgusting and her attitude was even worse! Yes, she is just doing her job, but did she really have to speak to us like that? There are a million different ways that she could\\'ve approached the situation that would\\'ve been far more professional. What is this? TSA at McCarran? To top it off, the male employee scanning our passes fed off of the female security guards energy and he was rude as well. Really, people?

       " 'Terrible experience on a Tuesday night. We arrived for dinner and stood around not knowing whether to wait to be seated or sit at any table (we did the latter). Started off by ordering Mango Lassi and it was below average quality. More watery and thin instead of being creamy and possibly not considered \"fresh\" as the menu description says. and the food took forever! my god, we finished ordering by 6:30 and finally received our orders at 7:20. over 45 minutes. the venue was only at 20% capacity with 4 tables of customers and a guy waiting for a to-go order he ordered beforehand, so it\\'s problematic to think this restaurant would be able to handle a full house or a few large groups if it couldn\\'t handle a slow night. and when we finally received our food, we can instantly tell that we\\'ve seen better Indian food at other places. The food was not \"fresh off the kitchen\" as our 3 dishes were already cooled down to just warm and began to be cold before we even finished. The portions were small for the price and the ingredients used were sub-grade. (we could tell that the shrimp was frozen and didn\\'t mix all the way with the sauce) add the fact that we waited this long for our order and not feel satisfied by it is disheartening as you receive the bill. Disappointing experience because this is the only Indian restaurant in the area of the West Valley (Goodyear, Avondale, etc.) before the next ones in Glendale and Phoenix. I suggest to skip convenience if you\\'re eating with a group and make the drive to the better ones located in Phoenix.',\n",

Dort saßen wir dann und warteten auf die Speisekarte, für meinen Begriff zu lange. Als die Bedienung dann mit den Speisekarten kam, musste Sie eine wieder mitnehmen weil sie selber feststellte das man so eine ledierte Speisekarte dem Gast nicht zumuten kann und brachte neue.Die waren zwar leserlich aber hatten wohl nur noch ein kurzes Leben vor sich. Tower Burger,  2 Cheeseburger, 2x gemischter Salat, 1x Cesarssalat, 3x Softdrinks. Der Cesarssalat war mit Dressing und Parmesan erschlagen, eigentlich müsste es Parmesan mit Salat heißen. Die Burger waren totgebraten, die Fleischeinlage soll saftig sein, nicht blutig aber saftig, diese waren so trocken das selbst das Topping keine Chance hatte da noch was zu retten. Pommes waren gut. Zu erwähnen wäre noch das die Bedienung ausser beim bestellen und bezahlen kaum zusehen war. Ein Brüllen gab's dann noch zum Schluss, nach dem bezahlen wurden wir noch freundlich gefragt ob Sie die Teller schon mitnehmen soll. Auch so, das ganze schlug mit 50 Euro für schlechtes Essen zubuche.\",\n",

Having all been there at least once before, we knew what we wanted to order going in the door. We sit down at a table covered in empty glasses and used napkins and stacked everything to the side so that the waitress would be able to pick them up easier. After sitting at the table right in front of the bar for 15 minutes the waitress came over and removed the dishes not saying a word, and not offering to wipe down the sticky beer covered table.  Another 5 minutes rolls around and the same waitress comes back and says \"what can I get you all to drink\". We told her that we wanted a pitcher of beer and a water and that we were actually ready to order our food (because we had already been seated for 20 minutes). She said \"sorry guys I need to get the drinks first then come back and take your orders or I wont remember everything.\" ...umm then get a note pad? The waitress then goes over to the bar and proceeds to flirt it up with the men sitting at the bar and about 10 minutes later she brings us our drinks. We have now been sitting for half an hour. She then says \"so are you all getting food?\" We tell her yes and she says...\"ok wait a minute I need to get a note pad.\" REALLY we told you already we were all getting food.  She finally takes our orders (thank god the kitchen is fast) we got our meals another 10 minutes later. As we are eating our meals, this same waitress then proceeds to TAKE HER SHIRT OFF and start dancing in front of the live musician....ok we know at this point you are eager for tips from the men at the bar...but come on, the rest of us don\\'t care about you trying to get attention, you just look like an idiot. We finish our meals and it\\'s time to pay. We asked the waitress to split the pitcher 4 ways and who she needed to bill for it. She goes \"really guys?\" my friend (having worked at a bar before) said to her \"I\\'ve used the same computer system as you, I know a pitcher can be split with the push of a button.\" The waitress rolled her eyes and about 10 minutes later brought us our bill and in a snarky voice said \"this is the best Im doing for you\" (really?! you are the worst waitress ever, extremely slow and now you\\'re being sassy). She had split the pitcher...but put it on the bills of the wrong people.  At this point we didn\\'t care to correct it...and figured the waitress wouldn\\'t have enough brain capacity to fix the problem, so we paid the incorrect bills and left. Let\\'s just say the extra tip money that she may have gotten from the men at the bar would balance out with the zero tip money we left at our table of 8...',\n",

So we arrived at 7:20 knowing that it was their busiest day, waited 3 hours to see only an assistant...left the building at 10:10. During check in they take you back to get your vitals. My son had a swollen thumb due to a soccer injury, they should have taken his x-ray during the vitals. We waited 2.5 hrs for them to take a x-ray and 5 mins to put a splint on and tell us it wasn\\'t broken just swollen.

They seemed to have charged me three times for the same thing. I was very disappointed with the wait time. When we arrived they told us it would be 1hr and 22 mins until we were to be seen, which I was fine with but that was not the case, it was 3 hours. Then they raped my insurance for charges that were unnecessary because we had only 5 mins of a P.A. time and 10 mins with the other assistant taking blood pressure, temp, weight, and x-ray. I do not recommend this location until they reduce their prices and get more staff. Not to mention when we went into the room to be seen they had a movie playing while I waited of Chris Farley that had foul language that no one knew was on, that my son was watching.

The lady at the end started rolling my burrito before I was even finished ordering. Never asked if I wanted anything else. Brought it home and right as I began to eat I noticed a decent sized black line on my tortilla - sharpie. Avoided the entire middle of my burrito.

       " \"I make the desperate mistake of calling yellow cab a couple times per year.  Since 2007, I believe I have had one cab actually show up within half an hour of calling.  I have had at least five waits of 2+ hours that required multiple calls each since their dispatch process has no interest in ensuring that cabs actually pick up the people calling.  I've had three calls where I was told emphatically multiple times that a car was coming only to be stuck someplace for hours before I started walking.  I once called for cab around midnight to be picked up in Bloomfield, called again around 1, and eventually just got a ride from somebody else at around 3:30.  Yellow Cabs dispatch seemed to believe it was my fault, because I apparently didn't call back enough to confirm I was still waiting. Of course, they don't tell you while you're waiting that you have to keep calling back on some arbitrary schedule, they just assume you know, or rather they use it as a convenient excuse to provide terribly bad service.  When you do get a cab, there's a good chance the car is in terrible shape and the driver is just rude.  I had one driver verbally berate me for wasting his time with a fare to the north side from downtown, literally stopping the car to mock me for asking if I could pay with a credit card.  I asked another driver if he had fives on him so I could tip him five bucks.  He told me no, so I just have him a twenty on an 8 dollar and change fare and told him to keep the change since I didn't really want to fight it.  He gave me back two fives as part of my change.  Seriously. This is the most poorly run company I have ever had the experience of interacting with, and they've been consistently bad since at least 2007.  The only thing you can rely on yellow cab to do is to make your travel around the city hard.  I'm not a weird edge case or anything because I use cabs at all hours of the day from perfectly safe neighborhoods like downtown, strip district, Bloomfield, etc.  Yellow Cab is terrible in all of these neighborhoods at all hours of the day.  It is completely maddening that they can continue to operate given the absolute abysmal failure that they gave proven to be as a company. To be completely honest, I am somewhat surprised that PUC hasn't investigated the wide swath of complaints surrounding yellow cab and consider stripping them if their license to operate.  If we are going to consider taxis to be a regulated utility, those people who use this utility should be able to rely on some level of consistency and reliability, if not also professionalism and courtesy that yellow cab is simply unable to provide.  I know it'll probably be a cold day for Hades before the PUC goes scrutinizing Yellow Cab, but I believe that this is objectively a legitimate, if not overdue response to their failure to provide basic service as a regulated utility.  We need to get rid of this broken company and make room for a company who is able to deliver.\",\n",

Our tab including forced gratuity (not right on small parties) was $34.00. Add the service fee: $40 for a comedy show. Not a deal, really. My other two friends reeled in anguish at their $74.00 tab. This is after we all pulled out our phones so we could see the stupid bills. Sure, make it dark and people will just pay it, right?! How do they expect people to pay these ridiculous fees? No prices on drink menu - how convenient. Felt very bait and switched, bamboozled. I was PISSED. Who are they to tell me how much to tip a server? Can\\'t see how this is legal.

We went with the cheese platter to start with, which was waaaay too much food for an appetizer. It used to be a small tasting, perfect for 2 but it appears they are piling the food on without regard to presentation or food costs. In addition, the waitress never came back to check in us. We would have ordered another drink halfway through the platter but were never asked-only given water and bread from the helpful staff.  After 45 mins the server FINALLY came back, never asked about the platter and offered to bring us more drinks but never suggested we order entrees. We were shocked!! This is not how servers treat patrons willing to spend $100+. We sat there an additional 45 mins with just our drinks and the bread basket between us!! If we hadn\\'t been so upset and wanting to have a nice evening out, it could have seemed like something straight out of a sitcom-completely comical. The server was the opposite of professional. Needless to say, the next time we were able to flag her down, we asked for the check and went to the bar to order more food and drink to continue our evening.

Chefs have really good talent in preparing the food with taste, authenticity and selection of varieties in buffet. Now comes to the service. Why the hell on this earth would someone work for something if they don\\'t or not willing to work. I went to restaurant on Sunday and i can hardly see one waiter in the restaurant. People were already waiting to pay their bills in front of the kiosk and that waiter is standing towards the wall and don\\'t bother to even take the payment from the customers. Finally someone was roaming here and there and i went to him in middle of the restaurant and asked for a table. He didn\\'t reply!..So weird!...i asked again. He pointed out a table with his index finger which was not cleaned yet. I said i want a booth. Voila!...finally he spoke saying \"Booth is for 4 people\"...Lol!..seriously is that the way you answer your customers?...Anyways i did math. There were 3 booths empty, it was 2:30, your restaurant closes at 3. And there was a group waiting to be seated which u don\\'t bother. That group is of 10 people. So they not going to fit in a booth anyways. And i see few of the customers are done eating, so you have 3 more booths left if you want to seat any customers . So total 6 booths are available and you have 30 minutes time , because your restaurant closes at 3. After this big explanation he said. OK!... I sat down...no water...no waiter..i see 3-4 waiters standing against wall just staring outside...not smile, i think they are all in pain....i wanted to ask if there is any problem but i thought it would be weird...finally someone came and gave us water. I asked if i can order from menu. He said sorry only buffet. That was weird too. If there is only buffet then put a sign outside saying \"Buffet Only\". Then he said OK i will take your order. He took my order. I ordered 1 plate medu vada. No sign of this guy for 20 minutes. Other waiters were just roaming here and there no one cares no one talks no one collects payments from customers this is weird place. I went to restroom i saw 2-3 waiters there just standing inside the restroom. Anyways my food came finally. And meantime i finished my water which they poured 30 minutes back. I want more water but no sign of anyone watching me. I have to get up my self and go near the kitchen where they stock up all water jugs, and pick up a jug and come back to my table and have that water. 1-2 waiters saw me doing this. no one cared to ask what i am doing though. The table beside me saw me and they also started to get up and get the water themselves from the entrance of the kitchen. I got angry but i enjoyed seeing very strange people all at a time. It was funny for me. I was in a restaurant for nearly 1 hour and all i spoke or or heard is . \"Booth is for 4 people\", \"ok\", Buffet only, \"ok\". Only these 4 words.  If you don\\'t train your waiters then you should probably shut it down soon. Your food is awesome and hats off to chefs who are brilliantly bringing various authentic vibrations of south Indian foods to us. But never coming back!... Finally they have dosa in buffet which comes to your table. And 90 percent of the people didn\\'t know that. They only serve if u go to the waiter standing against the wall and ask \"can i get dosa\". Then he will bring it up for you. I saw he bought 3 dosa\\'s for a table of 2.

After hearing my story, seeing the pictures of my hair before my poor haircut and what I actually wanted (just a trim really to fix the shape), along with instructions from my former hairdresser (to which he responded \"no instructions!\"), Ernesto brought out a pair of 80s style thinning shears and proceeded to start 2 inches from my roots and pull the shears through my entire head from top to bottom layer, telling me the whole time that my hair was too thick and his technique would give me the look I wanted. When he was finished there was more hair on the floor than there was on my head. For this, he charged me $125 plus tax. I went home horrified, tried to salvage it myself with different styles but it is so thin, straggly and lifeless nothing can be done.

Marcus' card reads he has 20 years of experience so I was expecting master class for the price of $25. I am a very specific customer that comes ready with pictures of haircuts that were done on me. I know the proper lengths of guards I want and the proper terminology to make the cut description clear.  What I wanted and generally get is a disconnected undercut, faded tightly on the sides, natural part, with convex and concave layering on the top. He had way more information on what needed to be done than an average customer...and guess what? Marcus cut it the way HE wanted, which did not reflect anything I showed or told him. He made errors on my cut that he was nice enough to correct, but the cut was still extensively flawed. These are the errors I received. On the first visit: -Entire side of my head was clearly faded longer than the opposing side. Confirmed by three other people. -One side of my head had jagged transition into the side part. -I clearly asked for 0.5 inch off the top and to keep it very long. He took off about 2.5 inches. Yep, I measured before and after. -Did not account for the shape of my head and my hair type. Faded straight into my hair without the proper tapering motions as you go up the temple and the towards the crown. Left me with an awkward shape and zero definition. -No straight razor neck shave Second visit (for the fix) -Tried to fix the side that was improperly faded. Didn't get it right the first time. Had to do it one more time. -Took off another 0.5 inches on the top towards the crown. Left me with a really awkward transition. Hair comes back even from a bad cut. The customer does not.\",\n",
       " \"Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive! However, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better.\",\n",

       " \"Well, today's the day I dump on SNMC unfortunately. As an east-coast transplant I knew nothing about naturopathy, but it has a good reputation out here and I thought since I'm paying for my own health bills I would try it out and see if a Naturopath could help me with a few minor issues.  The first time I went in I found out that my few minor issues were really deeply rooted systemic problems and immediately I was strong-armed into taking a $200 blood test to determine what food products I was allergic to. This is, of course, above and beyond the visit fees, which were not cheap either. Well, what do I know, I didn't realize everything revolved around my intestines so okay let's do this test and figure it out. Apparently I'm allergic to 13 different things, a 'fact' I seriously doubt. I'm not going to go into everything that took place with Dr. Crinnian and his residents, but suffice it to say I spent more than $600 with these people and neither of my two issues have been resolved. In addition to that I developed a rash and Crinnian wasn't available the day I called in so I made the first appointment I could get with Dr. Marchese. She had a better bedside manner than Crinnian BY FAR but prescribed me with something that made the rash worse. Super! The next time I saw Crinnian I told him the rash wasn't getting better and I guess he was pissed that I hadn't come in to fit his schedule because it was relayed to me through one of his residents that it wasn't his problem because he didn't diagnose me.  Well, no one at the medical center ever diagnosed me, ever. I was basically asked to diagnose myself with hours of repeated questioning of my symptoms. Even when I figured out what this new problem was, and told Dr. Marchese (I dumped Crinnian in a heartbeat and went back to her) that the only thing that has gotten rid of it before was antibiotics, I kid you not, she prescribed me a homeopathic remedy for COLDS WITH RUNNY NOSES. needless to say, that didn't work.  Taking into account all the supplements they insisted I needed to survive I'm sure I probably spent well more than that $600 in the five months I went there.   All Scottsdale Naturopathic Medical Center wants from you is money, endless streams of money and their doctors don't seem to actually care if they are helping you.\",\n",

I told her I wanted to cancel my appointment because 40 minutes on hold to change a time is unacceptable she gave some lame excuse about trying to call me (Total lie.

Surely not a warm greeting to this 1st time customer.  I tried to order several items on the menu, but was limited on my selections as they were out of chicken & ground beef.   I ordered 2 shredded beef enchiladas with verde (green) sauce, 1 bean & cheese burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  The lady told me they didn't have verde sauce so I went ahead with the red.  After ordering, she questioned me again about why I didn't speak Spanish and asked if it bothered me that I didn't.  After waiting a few short minutes, they had my food boxed up and bagged ready to go. When I got home, I was not at all shocked to see they fucked up on 2 of the 3 items ordered.  The bean & cheese burrito was rice and hardly any cheese and the shredded beef enchiladas were just cheese with no shredded beef...again, hardly any cheese.  Pretty much rolled tortillas drowning in red sauce.  The carne asada meat was half inedible gristle which I gave to my dogs.  ALL the food was cold...I live less than 3 minutes from this joint. I should've bolted when the lady at the counter started to comment to her coworker that I didn't speak Spanish.  Also, there were no other customers...another red flag.

The first appointment I made, I showed up at the requisite time and was told my appointment had never been confirmed and I had to reschedule. I did so and when I finally got in for my first B12 shot, the weight loss given was not in my best interest at all; the naturopath I saw basically recommended a diet that would starve my brain of the fats it needs to function properly.

       " 'Hong Shing is celebrating their 20th year anniversary, and as a result, they are offering a special dish each day at over 50% off. I was here on Saturday Feb 25th and they had Shanghai Noodles for only $5 ($10 originally).  Having been to Dundas West many many times, I have never thought of trying out Hong Shing before until now when my friends told me about the daily specials. Why? Because I just assumed it\\'s another generic westernized Chinese restaurant....and I was right.  Environment: Even though they have a good selection of food like a regular restaurant, Hong Shing is clearly also a bar. Right by the dining tables is a large bar counter and they have a big menu on the wall featuring their special drinks.  The renovation of the place is alright, but you can definitely tell that it had pretty much stayed the same way for 20 years. It\\'s by no means grand or fancy, but it is quite specious with lots of seating space, and it definitely gives out the bar vibe as intended.  Food: Between the 6 of us we all ordered the daily special Shanghai Fried Noodle and also the Crispy Pork Ribs (daily special for the day after) at full price.  The wait for the food was around 20 minutes, which I didn\\'t quite understand, because we were here at 4pm and there weren\\'t that many customers at the restaurant yet. And I mean...how hard is it to make some stir fried noodles.  When we finally got our noodles I was quite disappointed, because it pretty much looked identical to mall food court noodles, and the price of the day definitely matches it. There were couple pieces of BBQ pork and shrimps here and there, but the majority of the dish consisted of just noodles. The texture of the noodles tasted funny, as in kinda soft and squishy, and we kinda suspected that they didn\\'t use BBQ pork that was made fresh during the day.  It took about 15 more minutes to get the Crispy Pork Ribs that we were contemplating on cancelling the order. Now that I look back at it, we really should have. First of all, the dish looked nothing like the feature photo on the menu, and the portion was definitely too small for its $13 price point. But most importantly, it tasted nasty. As in, stale meat type of nasty. I\\'m not kidding, between the 3 of us who shared the dish we all agreed that the meat tasted funny (smoky, preserved meat taste) and the meat was so dry that it was really difficult to chew. Well, guess there\\'s no point to come back the next day, even if this dish goes on sale.  Service: I was ok with the average Chinese restaurant quality of service, up until when we asked about why our noodles were taking so long, and they brushed us off very impatiently saying that \"it\\'s coming\". I was thinking of cutting my tips, but then they charged us 10% gratuity because of our group of 6 :( I definitely would not come back for a second try, no matter how low they make the prices for the promotional period.

He did apologize however it was less than sincere. I just wonder how hard they are truly trying to rectify the situation considering I was able to look it up on google and see that I could buy one for less than what we spent on dinner. As I was eating dinner here tonight, I was thinking how this was such a great a place to bring out of town friends and family but unfortunately I will not be back. I will also make sure to let all of my mama friends know as well because no one should have to change their babies diaper the floor in public restroom.\",\n",
       " 'I got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich. The price was good and the staff were nice. The place is good to sit and enjoy the meal. UPDATE (8/3/14): it seems that drive-thro staff are a little different. Since I like the food, I wanted to try something new and asked for it by the number when driving through. I ordered something and the cashier was saying some details about which or what thing I want as the options. But I wasn\\'t familiar and asked her to repeat (and she was talking very fast) and she refused, thinking that I (We) are some kids playing with the mic.  I asked for the third time, and she said this is not funny (!) and I told her nobody is trying to be funny. So, she called the manager, and he just asked is what we wanted, ignoring what had happened and the food options. The cashier was disrespectful, and the manager was having her back being rude to us.... It was a really bad experience. They didn\\'t put any sauce for us in the bag and no receipt as well. At the window, when she saw us, she said \"I thought you are fooling around\". I am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this. I had a really bad experience with this TACO BELL... maybe if we were Americans, it could not happen... disappointing as we live in 2014....',\n",

Even the manager there, or supposed manager had no regard for what real service is these days. Two kids running a place like it was a joke.  First I was placed on hold for about 8 minutes. In that time I was holding I drove over there to place my order in person. The place was filthy with one customer there. I had to ring a bell since the door alarm was not enough to get there attention.  The girl approached the counter and looked like she was hanging out by the pool and was giggling the whole time. She didn't know how to even take my order or enter a coupon.  I ordered 2 extra large pizzas and 24 wings. She said that will be 69.87! I said are you sure? She said I don't know as she laughed and drank her soda while looking at me as if I was dumb. I asked for the manager at that point.  Bottom line this place needs the owners attention badly. I find it repulsive to think people run a business so hap hazardous. Service and quality is what I pay for and they sure don't deserve my business or yours.\",\n",

The rep looked at charger and noticed the problem and so hold on. Checked with guy in the back of the shop and said sorry you only had 30day warranty. Told him what original person told me, he reaponded o well it says it on your reciept (then pointed to his screen).  Said o well... Walked out and threw charger in trash.

Our food then took forever to come out and when it did it didn't come out all together and most of the food was already cold. The taste an quality of the food was pretty terrible.It also took a good twenty minutes and multiple request before we could get the check.

I've never had the Sossoman location refuse to turn on a hockey game, and we're very loyal customers. I get that Sunday is all about football but there were plenty of TVs  (many side by side on the same game).

       " 'The first time my boyfriend and I ate here, it was during the early evening, and very crowded - which we thought was a good sign. It took at least 15 minutes to be waited on, as waitresses passed our table many times before asking us if we wanted a drink. It took another 15 minutes to get said drink. We ordered food when our drinks came so that we wouldn\\'t have to wait, but it was another 30 minutes before dinner came. We both ordered a \\'pastie\\' dish - mine was chicken and it was delicious!! The best I\\'ve ever had, with a light pastry crust, filled with veggies and chicken, and a delicious gravy. The mashed potatoes were great too, with a chunky chicken gravy. I took more than half home because it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the beef pastie dish, and his was just as delicious. He cleaned his plate. Our second visit was a complete disappointment. (There were three of us). I think the reason we didn\\'t notice the overall appearance and condition of the restaurant the first time we went was because it was evening, and the place was dark and somewhat crowded. This time, when we walked in, we were hit with a strong dingy, musty smell. I wanted to turn around and walk out right then, but we had been driving a while and were all very hungry, so we decided to stay.  It was mid to late afternoon, and the place was nearly empty. We were seated at a booth in a corner. The booth was nasty - the chair covers had holes in them, the table top was dirty... the whole place was dirty - the floors, counters, everything. It made me cringe. Again, I wanted to leave, but the guys were so hungry, they wanted to eat. The place was not busy at all, but the waitress that sat us, did not come back to our booth for at least 15 minutes. It took anther 25 minutes just to get drinks. The servers hung around the bar, not attending to the few patrons in the place. I couldn\\'t find the dish I wanted on the menu, and when the waitress finally came back to our table, I asked her about it. She said they no longer had it, and the chef who worked at that time was no longer there. I was disappointed. I asked if there was anything comparable to it. She pointed out a vegetable pastie dish on the menu, so I decided to try it.  Our orders took forever to come. We finished our drinks and were not attended to for another 30 minutes when the guys meals came. Mine was still being made. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips. They were extremely dry, mostly batter with barely any fish in them. He pointed it out to the waitress, but she didn\\'t apologize or offer to replace the order. The french fries were dark brown - an indication that the oil was old and needed to be replaced.  My son had a cheese burger that was overcooked, dry and bland. His french fries were also brown and unappetizing. My order came out about 15 minutes later, and when I cut into the pastry, the vegetables were mushy and unrecognizable. I tasted it anyway. It was bland and mushy, no taste of seasonings or salt, disgusting. If there were vegetables in it, they were so overcooked, they were complete mush. I sent the dish back. The waitress came back, saying she showed it to the manager (or owner?), and that he said \"That isn\\'t how it\\'s supposed to be made.\" She then asked if she could have the chef make another. Seriously?? I declined. I wanted to walk out right then, but the guys were real hungry and decided to finish eating, even though they weren\\'t happy with their meals at all. At the end of the meal, the waitress brought our tab and my dish was on it. Of course, I had her take it off the ticket. We left disappointed, and I was still hungry. To sum it up:  Very dirty, dingy, and smelly. Poor, slow service. Terrible food.  Anyone who says this place has the \\'best\\' food in town, or that they have the \\'best fish and chips\\' - either has NO taste buds, or are friends with the owner. They would be doing a better service to be honest and get him to make the changes necessary to turn the restaurant/bar into a place people want to come back to. If changes aren\\'t made, I expect this restaurant to go belly up in the very near future. It might behoove the owner to call in \\'Restaurant Impossible\" or simply shut the place down.',\n",

The manager was pretty rude and she told me I couldn\\'t return ANY product, even if it was not open.

At the end of our meal, she didn\\'t ask us if we liked the food. I\\'m surprised that she is working in fine dining. Seems like she would be better fit at a sports bar.

       " 'It hurts to write a 1-star review for this restaurant.  That being said, do not alter a time-honored and familiar recipe.  There is nothing wrong with an addition to the  recipe, as the additions can be requested left out of the order.  However, it is wrong to replace ingredients that make up the basic presentation of the recipe. This afternoon, I found myself in Mesa for a shopping trip  to Mekong Supermarket.  We have a potluck event coming up at work and I wanted to scope out the place ahead of time for the ingredients I will need.  Seeing the sign for Thai Spices, the trip offered a chance to stop for lunch after I checked out Mekong Supermarket. On entering the establishment around 1:30 PM, I observed a clean dining room, with a pleasant ambience.  On picking up the \\'take it home\\' version of the menu, I read through and saw what appeared to be suitable offerings for a Thai restaurant.  As always, I looked for Som Tom, green papaya salad, the yardstick by which I measure all  Thai restaurants.  Finding green papaya salad listed, I was gratified.   With no indication whether I should seat myself or wait, I waited.  From entering to being greeted and offered a table, it was about 5 minutes.  There were about 10 people seated in the restaurant, so the wait was, in my perception, reasonable.  When the host came to me, he asked if I would prefer their table menu.  I responded that I found what I wanted, and I would like to be seated.   As I was guided to a table, the host advised I would see my wait person shortly.  He asked what I would like for my beverage and was quick to bring the water with lime I requested.  My waitress arrived shortly after and asked what I would be ordering.  I placed my order for papaya salad, omitting shrimp and long beans, served Thai Hot, along with an order of steamed jasmine rice.  The waitress asked if I could clarify my order, hot being 1-5.  I requested 6.  She wrote down the order and asked if I wanted another beverage in addition to the water.  I declined, and she went to the kitchen, advising I could anticipate a wait of 7-10 minutes for my order.  Sipping water, I waited for my order to arrive.        My order was presented at about 8 minutes.  The salad looked to be reasonable, about 2 cups and the rice about 1 cup.  Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce, each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.   On tasting the salad, I got lime, vinegar , garlic and spicy notes.  The spice was about 5 on a scale of 10 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  I caught the waitress\\' eye and when she came to the table, she asked if everything was satisfactory.  I told her that the salad was missing some ingredients, specifically fish sauce and palm sugar.  She apologized and took the order back to the kitchen. 3 minutes later, she returned with the same order, though it had been doctored with fish sauce and granulated sugar.  The chef had not remixed or even replated the order, only put fish sauce and granulated sugar on top of the previous order.  I asked the waitress to return this version to the kitchen and requested a new presentation be made, without the vinegar.  She went to the kitchen and returned with the same plate, telling me that the chef would not make a new order. I asked for the bill, and requested consideration as the order I wanted was not what I anticipated.  The waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to speak with the manager.  In replying that I would, she said the manager would meet me at the register.  I went to the register and on asking for consideration, the manager advised me that the salad was prepared exactly to my order, with no beans and no shrimp.  When I asked why vinegar was used instead of fish sauce, she said \"That is how it is listed in the menu.  Did you not see that?\" I paid my bill and left.  Oh, I have regrets...yes, I have many regrets.',\n",

He paid with our debit card and left. We checked out, went to the gas station to get gas to make it back home (Corona, CA) and it was declined. We pulled up our account on our phone and saw that we were charged $200.34. Which left us with NOTHING in our account.  We went back to the hotel and explained the situation.

       " \"DO NOT ORDER HERE!!!! CONSUMER BEWARE! I purchased some equipment around New Years time, but ordered over the phone because I had quite a few questions regarding my order. I told Gary in shipping that I understand I qualify for free shipping but that I need my order quickly and seeming that it was the holidays, I would be glad to pay the fee. He said I didn't need to do that and my order would arrive the next day. I felt uneasy about this and called back the next day to get an update on my package, which I ended up finding out I wouldn't be getting until the 4th. I told them this was a mistake and they sent me to the manager, Kurt. Kurt ended up returning my original package to sender and making a whole new order for me, I just had to pay $36 for the shipping. I thought everything was all said and done except they accidentally refunded my account, so yet again another mistake. They waited an entire month after I purchased my equipment to send me a letter in the mail asking for their money back. I'm all about integrity, so I called Kurt back and told him I was very upset by this entire thing, especially since he set this whole thing up. First my shipping error, now this. I told him the money got taken out of my account by mistake and asked if I could pay payments. He said I could and to just call back towards the end of the month and we'll work something out (which I was fine with). This entire thing bothered me so much, I decided to speak to the owner named David. I explained what happened in an email and he called me the next day, but before I could even respond, he took a $400 lump sum out of my account after I was told I could do payments and before I even authorized it. He pretty much told me because I got my equipment on time, I still owed them despite their mistakes. He wasn't willing to give me a discount and best of all, I was informed I could not do payments like I was told. The owner of this company was a completely greedy business owner. It's sad because I thought they were a good, honest company. I will never order from this company again. This entire situation was just a nightmare and I was the one who got the short stick in the end because of their mistakes. Don't order from here, you might get screwed in the end.\",\n",

It was a very very slow lunch, so when we walked in we were surprised to see no one at the host stand. We waited for a few minutes and finally a manager appeared to seat us. Our server appeared shortly after we were sat. I don't even remember her name, but she wasn't bad at all. She was probably the best thing about the whole experience - but that's not saying much. Anyway, my boyfriend ordered the beef teriyaki lunch but he wasn't a huge fan. I didn't try it so I can't say much else about it. I ordered freshwater eel nigiri - hard to mess up, spicy tuna roll - also hard to mess up, but it was also nothing special - and a softshell crab roll. I was definitely not a fan. The roll had too many other things in it that contradicted the crab - I ended up taking out the carrots and asparagus - too hard to put in a sushi roll! I was so put off by the roll that I didn't even finish it. It was a pretty expensive roll that should have just been kept simple like all other sushi places.  For dessert, we ordered the banana maki. Again, it was nothing too special. Overall, I wasn't impressed and was reminded why I stayed away from Ra. I think they try too hard to make different and unique rolls that it ruins the flavor of it.

Let me say that I read the reviews before hand, and I just knew I would regret eating here. I was not wrong. My 85 year old grandfather, who I only get to see once a year, is staying at the Sun Coast hotel, and that is the ONLY reason why we came to eat here. The other reviews for this place are on point. Bad, inedible, cold, under/over cooked canned slop. Nothing looked appetizing or edible. My first plate consisted of pizza, and a few pieces of sausage and peppers. The pizza was ok, although I had to drown it in Ranch dressing to taste good. The sausage was warm, not hot, and under cooked, as well as the peppers that were almost raw. I tried the prime rib and that was at least edible, with lots of au jus and horseradish. Desserts were a hit or miss. They had ice cream, a small assortment of cakes and pies, and some sorry dried out bread pudding.  So here I am at 240am after being sick in the bathroom for a half hour and that's why I am writing this review. Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this buffet! Do not go, even if it's free.

       " \"A&D came out in response to a home warranty request for an ice maker that was not working. The tech replaced the ice maker and it began making ice; however, the ice would not dispense through the door. Until the ice maker was working, I could not determine that this was an issue. I had to arrange another service call, and he came back and repaired the dispenser. I feel like it would have been appropriate and thorough for him to check this issue on the first visit. Six weeks later, the ice maker has now stopped making ice. Instead of calling my home warranty company, I called A&D directly and asked them to remedy the issue. They told me to call the home warranty company, who they claim only guarantees the work for 30 days (I have not confirmed this fact yet). I explained that I do not feel I should have to pay another service fee when there clearly is something wrong with a repair that only lasts six weeks (the original ice maker lasted 10+ years). The individual I spoke with was incredibly unhelpful. She made excuses for why the repair took two visits in the first place, suggested there might be something wrong with the manufacturer's part, etc. but seemed to feel no obligation to stand behind their work. When I speak with the home warranty company, I will ask them to send a different contractor because I have no confidence in A&D's work. I always try to give a company a chance to remedy a problem before posting a negative review, but I gave A&D a full opportunity to fix this issue and they had no interest in doing so or concern for their apparently poor work.\",\n",

Second, I had the homemade ravioli stuffed with fresh lobster and topped with arabiatta sauce and ricotta cheese.

For the final course I had the tiramisu. I love tiramisu and didn't think there would really be a way to mess up this dessert. I was wrong. It came out flattened and super wet. It seemed like it had been sitting a while and the ladyfingers were soaked in liquid. I only ate a few bites.

       " 'Since the moment i signed up for service 3 months ago, it has been nothing but a nightmare. 26.97 per month for 6 bottles of water and they provide the unit, sounds like a great deal to me. The rep drops off water every 2 weeks, so 3 bottles the first trip and 3 the second.Now if you dont put out 3 empties every time, you get charged for every extra full bottle they deliver. So before you know it, even though you may not need all of this extra water, they will continue to drop it at your door and charge you for it. Every time you have more than 3 bottles in your possession, you get charged 6 dollars for every extra full bottle and empty bottle that you forgot to put outside to be picked up. My bill for the past 2 months was anywhere from 50-80 dollars because they deliver more water than is needed. What they also dont tell you is that whatever moneys that is to be credited back to you from returning empties goes towards your water account ONLY, not back in your bank account. I finally had enough and called on July 26th to cancel and schedule pick-up of the unit and bottles for August 29th(today), i called back on august 7th to verify the cancellation and pickup date. I took off a day from work so i could be home during the hours of 8-5(what they give you) for pickup. I called an hour ago to double check and find out when my rep would arrive. Lady on the phone tells me there is no record of a pickup scheduled for today! There is a record of my cancellation but no pickup. She says she wants to schedule it for wednesday instead. I scheduled this a month in advance to insure i would be home because i work a lot and late hours. Also, she is only allowed to text the rep and request pickup for today. Next step, i askef for a supervisor...who does she transfer me to? The concierge! I tell him my dilema, he asks to put me on a \"brief\" hold. Finally another rep answers, not a supervisor and has no clue what my issue is so i, for the third time now, have to explain all over again. She looks in her system and sees oh yes, you were scheduled for pick up today but it got cancelled out somehow! She then sent out 3 emails (1 to her supervisor, 1 to my service rep and 1 to the service dispatch supervisor) to explain whats going on and that i need my pick-up scheduled for today and she will contact me once she receives a response.

So, to make a long story shorter, I will just conclude in saying that Sparklettes not only has horrible customer service but they do not know how to properly communicate with their customers or each other.

The old owner had told me they would track down other set of keys and owners manual, not too much to ask for a $38000 car.. was to by GM I could give them their keys back and I could have my trade back.. If I hadn't already been offered a profit on my jeep I would have been tempted to. . Was referred to owner and he basically said same thing but with attitude because I got the better of them in the deal.. Told owner we all make mistakes as on due bill.. could we meet in the middle and get me a key at cost, retail $360.. He tells me he's here the door is over there and I could stand in the middle. . After telling him I couldn't believe he owns a dealership and he was a dick head I left with smiles on the faces of all that heard.. they must know him well.. they don't strive for repeat business or referrals and do a great job of it.. too bad because the sales people and managers are great.. owner's a dick.\",\n",

       " \"Why bother damning Fraticelli's with faint praise?  It would be a waste of praise.  Toronto and its suburbs enjoy an Italian dining renaissance. From low end to high, this city has embraced the local, seasonal, soulful goodness that is rustic Italian cooking. I don't need to point you to the glowing reviews for restaurants that have been penned by better writers and bigger foodies than I.  Even the chains have gotten into the act. Toronto boasts decent pizza/pasta joints in Terroni and Mercatto. These places make a virtue of authenticity-in Terroni's case-to the point of obnoxiousness. The vibe is casual, the food fresh and well-priced. Cheap but drinkable plonk and short espresso flow easily. East Side Marios aims low; Toni Bullonis aims a bit higher.  So what did RIchmond Hill do to deserve the disaster that is Fraticellis? Were they bad?  Set in a big box block of similar corporate restaurants, you get the sense that Fratricellis is someone's attempt at a casual fine dining flagship on the order of Milestones or Moxies. All black walls, booths are crammed together so diners compete for elbow room and narrow tables make sharing a challenge.  Said tables are guarded by an attractive team of hostesses. We are nudged towards the bar despite a lack of 'reserved' signs, or any indication that somebody cooler will come along to commandeer one of the many empty tables. When we decline the wine list, the pace of the meal turns glacial.  We are serviced by a pretty but inexperienced wait staff, who huddle in the corners while we wait for drinks and bread that's fresh-baked, but only appears after appetizers have been served. By bread I mean a few slivers of what might be balled-up pizza dough. It's stingily portioned, accompanied by a puttanesca-esque olive oil dip which is the most flavorful thing we eat all night. Between the long wait and the mistiming, we resent it. Appetizers offer limited value. A small Caesar salad comes with curls of fresh parmesan, but wears a heavy garlicky coat of dressing. It's about a coffee-mug's worth of lettuce. Six bucks may not be a lot to ask, but there's even less offered here. A $12 Fritto Misto is an outright ripoff. Promised fennel is absent. Two types of zucchini range from pleasantly crisp to outright mush; and seafood is limited to a pair of decent shrimp and two rolled curtains of uncuttably overcooked calamari. The plate is taken away without asking why the squid sits, barely punctured.  Pizzas may be a popular item on other tables but they are tiny and topped with disturbingly unmelting cheese and uniformly circular condiments. But for the thinner crust, they channel memories of high-school cafeteria pizza hut.  Mains fail to inspire. Spaghetti is properly al dente in carbonara, but the sauce lacks any kind of salty punch beyond more freshly-grated cheese on top. It's a mystery considering the amount of cheese, bacon, onions and black pepper that go into this dish when done right. A massive hunk of chicken parmesan hasn't been trimmed of cartilage, and its red sauce is also muted, much like the chicken fraricelli, which arrives dry from the grill. Accompanying pappardelle noodles in sundried tomato pesto cream sauce need salt, but have nice texture. The less said about industrial veal piccata the better. We skip dessert and coffee. Most galling is the  presence of Massimo Capra's smug mug on the menu, moustache waxed and teeth bared in a villainous smirk. This man captained countless Restaurant Makeovers. He's listed as a consultant here. Maybe he can call in a friend from the show to bail him out.\",\n",

I was at an event recently with food trucks, including this one, and not being very hungry, I wanted a hot dog and fries. The sign said $5.  I ordered, and the lady told me it would be $6.50. I pointed out the $5 price on the sign, and she curtly apologized, played with her tablet, then told me it would be $5.50. I again pointed out the sign that said $5, and she briefly turned her tablet in my direction (like I knew where to look or could even see it in the bright daylight) and rudely told me that it was actually $5.50, and that I would need to give her 50 more cents.  I fumbled for another dollar in my pocket, and told her that she should change the sign as they're currently falsely advertising. She got up and changed it right after tending to me.  I'm posting pictures showing the sign, before and after the change. And to top it off, the hot dog wasn't even good. The $0.75 dogs at IKEA are much better.

We usually stick to Ruth Chris for special and intimate dinner dates, however, we decided to try the Chart House. First, let me say something nice, beautiful scenery! Now let me be honest, the food was horrible!!! For the price (which would not have been bad if the quality was there) we expected at least Ruth Chris middle range quality, however, we were disappointed with the luke warm clam chowder, soggy overcooked asparagus, wilted vegetable salad bar, bland fish entree, and bland and small shrimp with scallops entree. I guess the initial red flag should have been soon after we arrived, and received our initial cocktails, about 15 minutes later, we asked the waitress if it is common to offer a bread basket, her response, \"um, sometimes we do, it just depends if someone wants bread, would you like some bread?\" By then we had been sitting for more than 20 minutes and were hungry and ready to order our food, plus, who goes to a restaurant and \"has\" to ask for bread, they usually force it on you! Next, when our entrees were delivered we asked for tabasco because the food was so bland, she actually brought us a teeny tiny bottle of tabasco, you know, the size that they give you at a hotel when you order room service! Finally, she asked me if I wanted fresh pepper with my clam chowder, it was extremely bland, so I said yes, well, she disappeared and did not return until I was halfway through the bowl! The waitress knew that the service was horrible, so before she brought the bill, she sent out a complimentary dessert. Not all was bad, the next day we went to Twin Peaks Bar Grill, and we had the best experience, customer service was awesome, drinks were good, and the bar food was better than our Chart House meal!!',\n",

Generally speaking, the prices are competitive, and the work is reasonably fair. I came here today at around 1:45 looking for an exterior wash and to get my interior carpets and mats cleaned. As I pulled up, I got haggled several times to purchase or upgrade the services I was looking to have done. Politely declining their offers for $150 and $200 services, they agreed to give me a VIP wash and clean the interior carpets and mats for a total of $39.99. Aside from the haggling, I had to deal with their inappropriate staff asking how I could afford the car that I drive, and inquiring about my employment situation. Absolutely unacceptable, just as a side note. Anyhow, I got an estimate on the time it would take (from an employee named Caleb) to complete and they told me 30 minutes.  I started getting a little antsy after 45 minutes had passed of me waiting in their indoor lobby. So I went outside to wait, thinking it might already be done and waiting for me. Nope. I waited another 15 minutes, just watching my car sitting in the detailing area not being tended to. Then I started to get frustrated. I sent my boyfriend over to the gentleman who sold us the $39.99 wash and interior combo to see when the car would be done and that we waited over a half an hour more than we should have. In the meantime, I went over to the car itself to tell the serviceman who was \"working\" on it to forget about the rest of the mats and that I needed to leave. Upon walking up to my Jeep, I noticed a quarter-sized ding and scratch right above the door handle on the driver\\'s side door. Something that WAS NOT there when I dropped the car off. Upon looking at it, it looked as if someone had tried to wipe away the scratch, as there were small horizontal scrapes in the clear coat of paint.  I alerted the person working on my car and he came over with an armorall rag, rubbed it over the damaged area of my door, shrugged as it didn\\'t rub right off, and practically walked away. That\\'s when I started to get furious. He radioed a manager to come to the detail area. A few minutes had passed, and finally the \"manager\" or whoever he was arrived. For anyone\\'s reference, his name was Spencer. He looked at the damage on my vehicle and told me that there \"wasn\\'t anything he could do\" and that I needed to return on Tuesday to talk with another manager who can access security cameras. Basically, long story short, he told me that he didn\\'t believe his staff was at fault. Excuse me. But if you\\'re a so-called \"manager on duty\" then you need to be able to have access to security tape in case these problems arise. Spencer was absolutely rude and unprofessional, and didn\\'t do so much as apologize for the damage. This is when I started to lose my shit. He gave me the card of another manager and told me to call him another day. The card didn\\'t have a phone number on it. So he wrote the phone number of this specific Jackson\\'s location. Helpful, huh? Absolutely not. I tried to call the corporate office, but to my knowledge they are not open on Sundays. I sent a \"contact us\" form through their website, but let\\'s be real, we all know how well those usually work out. I left infuriated. I may be young, but I have worked too damn hard for my $55,000+ car. I put time, energy, and love into every aspect of my \"baby,\" just to come to the car wash and have it F\\'d up by unaccountable employees who will not admit to a mistake that was made.  Aside from the fact that my door is now all messed up, the wash was terrible, also. For $20 to clean my car, there were still splattered bugs on my windshield, a fresh streak of armorall on my driver\\'s side door (thanks to the greatly incompetent worker who tried to erase the ding and scratch that they made), dirt galore on the interior that was not vacuumed out, and all of my cleaned mats thrown into the trunk of my car instead of being replaced in their respective areas. Are you kidding me? Before I left, I told them about how even the simple task of a car wash was messed up, and that many things were left unattended to. They didn\\'t fix those problems, nor did they offer to compensate me for the wash.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this Jackson\\'s location. NEVER.

       " 'This Westin deserves to be called the Worst-Inn! I booked a room with a lake view and was hoping to have a relaxing stay-cation with my SO for the weekend. When I checked in I was told that they \"were at capacity\" and that I was apparently getting the last room they had, mind you the lake view room I booked was \"guaranteed\" but that didn\\'t seem to matter to the front desk. We were instead given a room that looked out onto the parking lot, as if we wanted to stare at more asphalt and cars after driving the 4+ hours to this resort. We shrugged it off and went to bed, tired from the long drive in. The breakfast buffet was lackluster except for the employee cooking 6 omelets at a time, pretty much the only exciting thing to see at this resort. We quickly ate our meals, eager to see if the pool and the other \"amenities\" the hotel claimed to offer would make up for the room mishap. We received the bill and paid. The total for the breakfast buffet for us two came out to roughly $40. The tall, blonde server with the ponytail (John) was quite attentive and very friendly so I decided to leave an $8 tip ($3 on the card and $5 in cash). When he returned with my card and receipt I noticed he had decided to tip himself $10 on the card and pocket the $5 bill. I\\'m so sorry the 20% tip wasn\\'t to your liking! Fast forward to the pool and we find a nice area by the cabanas. Every lounge chair we encountered had spots of bird feces on it. It\\'s a good idea to grab extra towels to use as seat covers if you decide to stay here. Also don\\'t expect any poolside service either, the employees tend to congregate around the bar area and will shoot you shifty-eyed looks if you get too close. Should you need a non-alcoholic beverage, you can expect quicker and friendlier service from the vending machines. Oh and don\\'t plan on kayaking if you\\'re staying on a weekend, chances are you\\'ll be waiting for hours since there\\'s usually a waiting list and they only have 4. If you are looking for some R&R on the lake book the Hilton and reserve a boat rental at the marina in the Village. Also don\\'t forget your fishing pole. You can leave your tackle at home since this Westin already supplies the bait-and-switch.',\n",

Well this has happened at all the Sprouts I've been to at least every other time I shop there.   I've even had clearance items charged full price because the cashier ignored the orange tag.  WTF!  The solution to all this is easy.  The cashiers need to pay attention to their job and look at the 4 digit codes or stickers on the items and enter it into the computer appropriately.  But they don't.   I know it's only a few dollars difference at times, but really, I'd like to pay exactly what I'm supposed to instead of playing produce price roulette.

The gentleman I spoke to said they don't reccommend tinting t-tops (because excessive heat build up can cause the glass to explode) but they could do it.

I have also tried to call them 5 more times between yesterday afternoon and today, they are not answering their phone and their voicemail is full. I would be cautious using these guys.

       " \"I had been wanting to enroll my son into some kind of sport so when I saw a LivingSocial deal for Diversity Youth Sports (DYS), I found it to be the perfect opportunity. They are a pretty hands off company that just finds people in a similar zip code and puts them together for a mere $95. That was fine because we liked our volunteer head coach and the other children on our team, but about a week in I got an email saying our first game will be pushed back 2 weeks yet the season will not be expanded so we lose 2 weeks of games.  The week after that, I got an email saying how our team shirts won't be completed. The following week, I got another one saying all team shirts are done except baseball (our sport of choice). That weekend, our first game was announced and it's located in North Las Vegas. We were promised that our games would be played in Summerlin, close to our zip code. Instead, we're supposed to trek 1 hour to North Las Vegas and back 1 hour every week. My son enjoyed baseball but didn't want to play THAT badly so we dropped the team as did our head coach and several other families.  When I contacted DYS via e-mail (they apparently got a phone number very recently, but during all of my correspondences, e-mail was the only way), telling them that they didn't hold up to their promises of our game location and I wanted a refund, they would only give me a credit. Why would I want a credit for a company that's a hot mess? No thanks. I also said I was dissatisfied with the shirt situation (shirts weren't even done by the first game) and the lady told me that they were done and asked if I had gone to practice lately. A couple days later, I received a text from the new coach saying he finally has our shirts which were indeed NOT ready and available prior to the first game. Total waste of money.\",\n",

Apparently the casino has the right to set their own prices. The manager refused to give my sister a refund and was not very apologetic either.

I originally booked for a two queen terrace suite 4 months in advance and we checked in two hours prior to \\'Check in time\\'.   We were told we would get notified via text when the room was available - never happened.  We went to the front desk for a second time to a more helpful person and they gave us a one-bedroom suite - which we were told was an \"upgrade\".  We needed two beds and we were told that we could get a two queen terrace suite the next day. We asked for the sofa bed to be made that evening around midnight when we would be gone and they confirmed it would be assembled upon our return back to the room.  This was never done, so 2 people had to sleep on an uncomfortable sofa bed.  The next morning I did call to express my disappointment, and they came to make the sofa bed at 12:00 (noon time).  We asked for the two queen terrace suite (we called early around 9 am) and we were met with resistance from the front desk.

       " 'I moved into this apartment complex because I had no other options due to the fact that my boyfriend (at the time) had terrible credit and could not get approved anywhere else in Old Town. Reana and her other staff member (who was eventually fired) seemed very friendly and like they cared about making everything super easy for us. After we signed the paper work and already gave them money to move in, they let us know the apartment wasn\\'t ready when we had paid them to move in. I had no choice but to move into a un-finished apartment because my other lease was up and I could not renew at that point.  When they said the apartment was unfinished they were not kidding, they didn\\'t even paint the walls again, there was crayon markings on the wall, mold in the corner of the shower, the apartment just looked so run down and dirty, nothing like the model they showed us. The painting on the drawers and cabinets were chipping off, and even the vent above the oven had paint that had been chipped off and it was just metal showing. I could not believe my eyes. I did the walk through so detailed and wrote down every little thing that was wrong with this apartment. When I turned my walk through in and expressed that I wanted this stuff fixed they said they would. They never came back to repair or finish up the apartment at all.  Over the span of time that I lived there, I had to put in a work order at least twice a month. The garbage disposal was constantly breaking, the toilet was not working at all in the guest room for months. They tried to blame me saying I put litter down the toilet from my cat, and I told them to go look on the back porch in the trash can that I had disposed litter in.  My AC unit started to leak and leaked water onto the carpet below, and they said they couldn\\'t come when I mentioned that could create mold and that\\'s a health issue Reana sent someone over. You had to argue with Reana to get her to do anything because she was so lazy and unappreciative of her tenants. My sink in my master bathroom was clogged for over a month, and I had called every week and it was always an excuse why they were not there yet to fix the issue. I looked in the electric box in my apartment one day, and discovered the apartments were built in 1974, and it\\'s obvious they have never done any remodeling. There are also roaches crawling around outside the apartments, and sometimes I found a few in my apartment. Clearly they are not making sure their tenants maintain a clean dwelling unit.  The cops were called at the complex at least once a month for something going on with a tenant, and loud neighbors everywhere. Most of the tenants let their kids play and scream all day and most of the night outside with no adult supervision. I could never talk to any of the parents about these issues at my apartment complex because no one spoke English, nor would Renea ever attempt to control the issue. Her other staff member Suzy would always hand the phone to Renea whenever there was an issue because Suzy didn\\'t want to deal with it either.  When I moved out of the apartment complex, I spent an entire day cleaning my apartment to make it like new, vacuuming/shampooing the carpets, repairing an wall damage my ex had left, and made sure it was livable for the next person since I knew the staff wouldn\\'t ready the apartment for the next person. I did my own walk through of the apartment, and took pictures of everything, including the floors.  After I moved out, I received a bill from Oasis for $250 for pet damage, and \"red stains\" on the floor. I called and spoke with Renea about the damages, and let her know I had pictures of the floors and there was no red stains, and she said, \"I have pictures too, and there is.\" When I asked her to show proof of these pictures, she refused to show me anything, and I even offered to go down there and see the unit and she told me no. She then said she will send the bill to collections, and I informed her that\\'s fine I would be happy to dispute it and let it become a legal matter seeing as I work in an attorney\\'s office. She magically stated out of nowhere that was fine and that was what her attorney and supervisor advised her. She also tried to say, \"You had a cat in the unit and were not paying for it.\" My reply, \"Renea I did let you know I had a cat because when I put in the 20th work order I told you to tell the workers to be careful my cat did not get out, and you never asked me to come down to sign a new agreement to pay more.\" She had no reply.

Things go as normal until he decides to take a phone call, I never got his attention back.  Two guys showed up and he went outside and met them, in the middle of my manicure, and showed them inside and talked it up with the owner for awhile and finally remembered i was there and he finished my manicure up finally.  Did I mention when he went outside to meet them he took another smoke break?  Still didn't even bother to wash his hands.  Pedi time! Guess what? No water! It had to be turned off to take the chair out.  They finally get it back on but can't stop it, so there is water everywhere! Needless to say, dude did my pedi too and was so concerned about mopping up water and the putting in his two cents on the owner's discipline of his daughter that I got a real crappy pedi.  Didn't do the top coat and didn't get the sides or the top of the toenail.  Plus he dropped my shoes in the water and I had to climb over mounds of towels to get out of the chair.  I go to check out (I added gel and french to my mani so I had to pay extra) thinking for sure they would tell me no charge for one if not both...nope, that will be $20.  UGH! I am not one to throw a fit, and they are so lucky, but I usually feel comfortable at least asking for what I paid for.  Not with this guy, I didn't even want to talk at all, when I did i got the super evil eye....like when he was about to use purple polish for my gel nails.

Spoke with Linda friendly enough, she had to send me all the paperwork before she could schedule my service visit, (she wanted my Credit Care info) and it would cost $119 for the  assessment . I agreed gave her all the info she needed.  Then I was scheduled 10 days out.  I have no dog & didn\\'t have a lock on backyard at the time so, Paul just came into my yard and assessed my spa.  Humm, Paul called me couple hours later and said $425 would make my spa just like NEW again.   Alright! Fix it!  So I also needed a new spa cover which I ordered thru actual Hot Springs which costs $650 installed.  So now I have $1075, in an older Spa that Paul said would be just like new.   The next week my husband went to get in the spa and it was cold and he noticed a leak by one side.  So I call Linda to schedule another visit, because my like NEW spa now doesn\\'t heat and has a leak, she is not there and I leave a message it takes her several days to get back to me.  Linda calls me back, it\\'s a completely different person, defensive and nasty.

That was just to assess the leak, just like before.  Now if I were to have it assessed again but with a lift I would have $2075 into it and it isn\\'t even repaired.

I was planning to bring in my family and my dogs since I noticed dogs walking around, the Delano must be pet friendly so I inquired and got a rate which sounded a little steep, $215 and $315 for the second night.  When I came down to book the room I was met with a cold, bone chilling attitude from Stephanie who was working the front desk.  Not only was she cold and aloof with me verbally, but she wasn\\'t helpful and was argumentative despite the fact that I was extremely nice in the entire conversation.  I basically had to rephrase how I got the rate twice and all the while she helped me with the air and attitude that she didn\\'t want to.  After finally getting the rate, even after 2 conversations, NO ONE tells me there is a $50 per dog fee per day even though I made it perfectly clear that I needed a room for my dog. This essentially raised my rate to $265 and $365? Really? Not only that, but the sense of happiness and achievement that I felt emanating from Stephanie\\'s pores on \"exacting revenge\" on this customer was palpable.  This is DISGUSTING customer service and I recommend that no one patronize a hotel with this service.  After all, you are paying top dollar for a great room AND great service.  For $365 I could have stayed anywhere and to be honest, I\\'m looking as I type this.  Don\\'t patronize this hotel.',\n",

They're skinny/shoestring fries and should not have cooked as long as they did. Even the sauce that came with it couldn't save it. Save your money, the food here sucks. Unless you crave bland food I would definitely pass this place. Go to Nathans instead.\",\n",

       " 'My boyfriend and I came in for a 9pm reservation on December 23rd after watching Jersey Boys right next door. From the moment I arrived, I was instantly put off by the place but my boyfriend seemed to actually be excited to dine there (he loves Gordon Ramsey for some weird reason) that I didn\\'t hesitate and dined anyway(it was his birthday, and also our anniversary). Hostesses were nice. They asked if we had dined before and gave a brief overview of the place, for example how the red \"tunnel\" we passed through entering the restaurant was apparantly the \"transition\" from Vegas to England...okay. And the cluster of lights on the ceiling were Ramsey\\'s hand movements as he made the Beef Wellington. The ambience felt very \"club\"- like and super casual....definitely not an ambience I want if I\\'m spending Benjamin\\'s on a single steak. Hostess led us to a nice table on the second floor and handed us our linen. Nice touch.  Our server came over and was very nice and sort of informative. However, there was absolutely nothing on the menu that caught my eye. My boyfriend ended up ordering the oysters for appetizers and apparently was the one good thing throught the whole experience. However, no one seemed to acknowledge we were celebrating both a birthday and an anniversary.  I ordered the beef Wellington. Most. Bland. Thing. Ever. It had no taste at all but because I was THAT hungry, I ate it all. My boyfriend had the filet and he thought the same of his entree, super bland. Nothing special. In fact I believe we would\\'ve gotten better steaks at Norms.  Our busser even seemed offended that I asked for more bread....as that was really the only thing I enjoyed and was APALLED when I asked for ice for my water.  Never once did a manager stop by our table either to ask how we were doing. If it wasn\\'t for our server being super nice I wouldn\\'t have even left a tip. It was the single most worst dining experience I have had. For a $250 meal for two I expect fine quality but what I got was diner quality.  Don\\'t waste your time here. If it wasn\\'t for the fact that we had watched Jersey Boys before dinner, the night would have been a complete disaster for me. I\\'d rather watch Jersey Boys back-to-back-to-back than to dine at this establishment again. I already made my reservations for Carnevino for my next Vegas visit in February.',\n",

Worked fine until feb 2016 I had to get my first break change which is normal. So I paid full price to have my brakes changed tire rotated and oil change. I come back a month and a half later for another oil change and he tells me again I need new breaks. So I tell him I just got them done and they tell me I haven\\'t so I confirmed yes I did and they say oh actually I do see you got them done so good thing is is they will only be 160$ instead of around 280$ and I said no I have only put 6000 miles on those breaks and I don\\'t need them done. So he calls me back again and tells me oh what if I can do it for 140$ and I told him no and returned back to the dealer with the paperwork to show them my break pad inspection sheet they give me each time. So they admitted someone charged me for my breaks and didn\\'t actually do them. They offered to correct the mistake but I ended up trading that 2015 Mazda 3 in for a 2016 Mazda 3.  - first oil change on my brand new 2016 Mazda 3 on feb 28th the oil change took over 2 hours with a scheduled appointment and I get my car back and it smells horrible I can\\'t figure out what it is. Well whoever worked on the car was smoking inside my car and dropped a cigarette on my seat. That partially melted my seat cover and left it there. I got in my car so fast I didn\\'t see it so when I get home and get out there it is right on my drivers seat (I don\\'t smoke cigarettes, I think they\\'re gross) picture will be attached. - may 30 I return for another oil change and tire rotation. it was fine I left and now a day and a half later my tire is completely flat. This is the second time this has happened. On October 8th I also had this happen(it actually completely blew out on the freeway). So in October I thought well that\\'s weird and let it roll off because things happen but now this is two times in under 8 months that within a day of leaving the car dealership my tire goes 100% flat and they tell me I have no warranty. I purchased this car 6 months ago and I call to advise them this is the SECOND TIME this happened right after I left the dealer and I\\'m told it\\'s \"NORMAL\" because we live in a hot place. I got my car in November and this is May we haven\\'t even reached the hot months. Then she tells me well we have had a few hot days. This place is full of excuses.

I took my 370Z into AutoNation Nissan in Chandler to have my convertible top looked at because it was going down slow and when i came to pick it up they said it was in perfect shape and back to factory standards. As I was leaving, I tried to put it down and it was still having the same issues. So I told them to keep the car and fix it and i would come back tomorrow.  I then got a call from them the next day informing me that one of my brackets was broken and neither my Nissan Warranty nor my extended warranty would cover the repairs. Then they asked me if I was sitting down.  They then informed me that the cost for the part to repair my top was $17,000, yes you read it right Seventeen Thousand Dollars!!! That was just for the part.  It's pretty funny that the day before the top was perfect, but now the bracket was broken. My 7 year old granddaughter could see where the bracket had been broken when I brought it home after they broke it.  If she could see it right away why couldn't a trained auto technician do the same.  Hum, I think we all know what happened. ..they broke it!!! After spending months trying to talk to Auto Nation & Nissan and my lawyer sending them letters they still refuse to fix it.  I am angry with Nissan and I despise Auto Nation. I am not asking for the world , I am just asking them to fix what they broke.  Shame on both of them. At least Nissan had the class to respond to my letter, but Auto Nation, nope not a peep from them. If this is the way they do business, I nor any of you, should be subjected to their corruption.

When I checked in I was offered a $10/night room upgrade to the Royal Tower, which was supposedly recently renovated. The upgrade seemed to be a mismatch of old furniture moved in from another hotel (I've heard rumors that the old stuff from Mandalay Bay was used). That said, the overall appeal was lacking as the carpet and wall coverings were still severely outdated. The bathroom seemed to be in better condition and more recently updated, but was filthy. The first morning I took a shower, looked over and there were several hairs above my height stuck to the wall. Long hairs. Pretty much impossible to miss if you were cleaning a shower, and they were not mine. There were also several long hairs underneath the sink, keeping a collection of dust bunnies company. Coupled with odd sticky substances on the inside of the bathroom door and all over the room's window (on the inside of it, not the outside), I shudder to think what stains the carpet has if you were able to see them; fortunately the color and pattern prevents that. I wore flip flops at all times. On the bright side, my initial bed check revealed no bed bugs and so although I was disappointed in the overal cleanliness of the room, I didn't make a fuss. Other cons: Length of time to check in. Salespeople at EVERY ENTRANCE. Seriously, get rid of these clowns!! Casino and room hallway smell. Very distinctive and cheap/gross smelling compared to other hotels. Pros: Fitness center. Although small, it's clean and well stocked. It doesn't smell weird, either. There was an odd gal doing crunches on the ab machine for about 35 minutes straight one evening that gave me pause, but there's nothing Excalibur can do about weirdos :) All told, I'd forgive the outdated look and over-the-top air freshener for the supposed cheap price (although, once you factor in the resort fee, it's really not that cheap anymore), but I can't forgive sloppy housekeeping.

As a matter of fact, part of our job was to remove the \"made in China\" stickers that accompanied the merchandise upon delivery, especially all the glass art, which they will tell you is Murano, but that is farthest from the truth! You can find nicer glass vases at Ross for a fraction of the price! The place may seem like there\\'s no general business, but believe me, they\\'re not looking for that. The whole point is to wait days, sometimes weeks, to land that one big sucker. And every now and then, you\\'ll get a customer that can and will drop $150,000 or more for stuff that costs then less than a tenth of that! And I\\'m not going to lie, that\\'s what all of us salespeople are waiting for. We have no mercy. I\\'ve made commissions as high as $50,000 on a single sale. The problem is, Carlos will never pay you all of your commissions. You might get $10k or $12k of that and never see the rest. He knows he can get away with that because the salespeople can\\'t even earn that kind of money anywhere else so we become greedy enough to stick around. But I was sick of being robbed by home, so I decided to leave. The owner is a drug addict, alcoholic and a thief. It\\'s not uncommon to see this guy in the back doing lines of cocaine and completely wasted. He\\'s a violent man that has physically abused not only his wife Lucy, but his employees too. Want proof? Just look up his public profile. The only reason he\\'s not in prison is because he has the money to hire good lawyers. You want more red flags? This is one of the only businesses that does not utilize a POS system or bar codes of any kind and your invoices are always hand written. Why? because nothing there has a fixed price! Therefore, the value is as much as an unsuspecting customer is willing to pay and they can hand write whatever that price is at that point. Furthermore, they will tell you Murano glass or Swarovski crystal or Versace furniture, but they will never write that on your invoice because it\\'s not! Instead, they\\'ll put down \"glass vase,\" \"crystal chandelier,\" or simply \"sofa.\" And 99.9% of the time, they get away with it. They\\'re sleek and professional and only a handful of people are good enough to be con-artists. If you\\'ve already made a purchase and feel the pain, they will make getting your money back impossible. But you can still fight. Your best bet is to call your credit card company and begin a dispute. But besides that, also contact the Better Business Bureau, call Consumer Affairs, but most important, contact the hotel or the landlord of the building. They will do everything to make sure that the customers are happy and he may be forced to give you your money back. Wronged employees should contact the labor board.',\n",

I called to let them know I was having problems on several occasions and they never returned my calls. The staff is rude and very busy chatting with each other.

I arrived here with 4 other people about 6pm on Wednesday, the place was so packed that a server offered us to go upstairs - to which we went and had the whole top bar to ourself.... interesting. Anyhow - we decided to go back downstairs when my mom noticed a free table which the server had not told us about. So we took the chance to grab it and proceeded to tell our waitress that we had moved. Mind you this was about 10 minutes after already waiting. Upon telling our waitress that we moved tables, she looked at my mom and said \"OH... YEA, what did you order again?\" as if she forgot all about us.. and she DID by the confused look on her face. With the place as crowded as it was, we were understanding and then ordered our 2 medium pizzas and only chose from the regular topping menu. Not that complicated, right? p.s we ordered 1 round of drinks while we waited. Half an hour passed and my mom decided ask our server how long it would take. It seemed like our waitress was taking more phone calls and take out orders than worrying about the actual inside of the restaurant.  She said she would check the back, but she never got back to us. Another half an hour later passed... we all went out for a smoke. We all got more drinks - because of this long wait, there really wasn\\'t anything else to do. An hour an a half later (LITERALLY), my mom once again politely explains that we\\'ve been waiting for too long for such a small order. The people sitting behind us who clearly came after us had already gotten their pizza way before us. The server then explains that there was a mixup in the order and we would have to wait 20 more minutes... This wasn\\'t even her coming up to let us know. This was my mom having to ask her what the fuck was taking so long.  Suchhh bad service and way too polite of a family - this place has no consideration. We told them to forget it, and that we were leaving. We only paid for our 1 round of drinks, because frankly, they owed us for our time wasted. We then left -  STILL STARVING, PIZZALESS, AND SUPER ANGRY. Very disappointing... I must say. Ordering from Dominos would have been quicker, sadly.',\n",

The only reason I chose this hotel or came on this trip was because of how confident they sounded about being able to get this done.  Well I am here now and was given the run around for over an hour this morning. The bottom line is they did not uphold any of their promises to get the breast milk back to my baby, in fact they don't even know how to handle such a request. They have my calls on file but they were not prepared to do what they guaranteed they could do and wanted to charge me five times more than what they quoted me to get the milk home IF they could figure out how to do it. What happened to they do this this all the time??? I am completely appalled. When I asked for some kind of compensation they said they could give me $100 and that's it. Are they crazy???

I checked in yesterday and am staying until tomorrow although I wish I weren't. I have a room in the North tower and I don't even mind the music from Fremont although I do mind sharing a wall with the maid service backroom, ice machine, elevator, and soda machine.. Not to mention the 3 large a/c units running outside my window, which I have to keep open, because the a/c in the room is busted, making it uncomfortably hot. There was an unauthorized charge on my card for another night and I took the issue up with the front desk, even had my bank on the phone, and the manager Ruby said she didn't see the transaction on her end so she doesn't know what to tell me other than the hotel was not at fault for the extra charge? Ridiculous. At that point I requested a room upgrade and told her about all of the noise which made it difficult to sleep, the ice dropping in the ice maker, the maids banging around in the supply room, the elevator going up and down, and on top of that the ac didn't even work. She pretended to scroll through her computer for a second then said that there were no rooms available which was a lie because I checked the availability on the Four Queens website and there are a variety of rooms available for tonight. Ruby was unwilling to solve any of my issues and insisted that it was mine or my banks fault for the extra charge which was my biggest problem, she didn't even attempt to locate the transaction she claimed wasn't showing even after I told her that with the extra charge my account is overdrawn leaving me with no money for the remainder of my stay. All she was able to do was give me $20 food credit to their restaurant, which is only good for 12 hours.

       " 'What should I call this review? Can I give this half a star?  \"Bada Boo!\" or \"Bada Doom\"  I went to Bada Boom Pasta Room in Scottsdale Saturday Night to celebrate a friend\\'s birthday with 11 people. All other restaurants were booked in the area that night so this place was the last resort. The organizer of the birthday bash had called earlier in the week to make reservations and was told that there was a comedy event on the patio. \"No problem\" they said, \"we can accommodate you\". Half the party was already seated at the table when I and another friend walked in at 8:30. The waiter was there taking drink orders when we walked in. (They were seated at 8:00). Drinks showed up around 9:00. A staff member came and said that our server was overwhelmed and that he was going to take over for us. (It was her third day). Food orders were taken around 9:15. I asked the waiter what the soup of the day was and he said that they were out of pizza. I was going to order pizza. I had to ask him a second time what the soup was. He then finally informed me that there was no soup. Well finally orders were taken from everyone. FIVE rolls were brought out for 11 people. ROLLS at an Italian restaurant?? I was expecting garlic bread. So everyone did not get bread. We asked for more and then we were brought what now looked like 30 rolls 10 minutes later. As we were waiting for our food, I could see the food prep area where a man was preparing dough for pizza! I though they were OUT of pizza. What the heck was that I could see? Food came out around 9:30 . Some people got their food. One person did not have their food prepared as requested. She is allergic to something that she asked be removed from the food. My food was brought to me. The server called it \"tricolor tortellini\". I recall ordering \"tortellini di mari\" That was the exact name on the menu. Everyone was eating their food so I went to the restroom. I was hoping that my food would be out when I returned. It did not. We later asked the manager to remove it from the bill along with the other mess ups that night. He argued with me that my food was brought out twice and that I would not take it. Here is my point about my order: If you call it something on the menu then you must call it that same name when you bring out to the customer. Since we asked that my food be removed from the bill the manager left. He never came back. Instead, he was standing out from watching a charity performance on the patio. WTF!! We were left at the table trying to decide if we pay for the bill or ditch. Bada Boo! needs to rethink their ability to accommodate a large charity event and general diners. It appears that they cannot juggle more than 2 balls at one time. A staff member said that it was not good since they were missing a bartender, out of pizza out of soup, and short on staff. I am pretty sure most of the people attending the charity event got EVERYTHING that they needed. Bada Doom! get your act straight on your operating procedures.

       " \"I wrote a quality of care letter to Scottsdale Health Care per instruction from their staff which explains the entire experience.  There is an additional breach of trust which I explain at the end of this document.  In this letter I clearly outline operational problems with their staff, poor communication, and unsanitary practices. I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the services I received on 10/06/2012 on various grounds.  On the aforementioned date your hospital is under the impression that I was treated for the following affliction: My wife and I arrived at the emergency room and waited for 30 minutes to see the nurse who asked me several questions about the pain.  I was advised to give a urine sample with no further instructions.  I left the sample in the bathroom not wanting it to cause a health hazard by carrying the sample back to common grounds of your hospital.  I was later asked where the urine sample was because the nurse could not find it.  We waited another 30 minutes to see Dr. David S Rosenberg who asked the same questions as the nurse did when we first arrived.  The doctor advised me to have a CAT scan which I declined due to increased risk of cancer for being 25 years old.  The doctor then advised I get a radiology exam, which I did not have the common sense to decline as I was in a lot of pain and trusted his opinion.  I waited another hour for the exam and results that came back empty.  The doctor then prescribed Percocet without asking if I had any sensitivity to strong drugs such as oxycodone.  The doctor then left without another word or writing the prescription.  I had to later ask the nurse for the prescription, unaware of the side-effects, after the nurse had dismissed me.  I experienced nausea and diarrhea later that evening because of the medication, and I stopped taking it after one dose because Advil is strong enough to treat the symptoms of kidney stones.   There is a lot that should have been done differently.  I spent 3 and a half hours patiently waiting for help, which is unacceptable had this been a life threatening incident.  I was subject to neglect and unprofessional care when my urine sample was misplaced.  The staff has demonstrated to us that our time and my health care related needs aren't as important to them as they would be in any other place we normally would go to. It came to our attention that both the doctor and the hospital were trying to collect money for reading the radiology exam.  This could be interpreted as profiteering.  The doctor is trying to collect $710 for 15 minutes of his time and Scottsdale Healthcare claims I owe $769 for terrible quality of service and prolonged waiting.  The insurance company Aetna has covered charges that are not reflected on the bills.  Therefore, we are not going to pay the requested amounts and would appreciate having this matter investigated, and appropriate action taken to resolve it as soon as possible. I would imagine in the state of Arizona, we deserve quality driven, cost-effective, culturally appropriate, and person-centered health services.  If we receive any further threats to turn these bills over to the collection agency, while we are trying to nicely resolve this issue, we will file a full, detailed report with the Arizona Department of Health Services.  We will include all of the documents we have reviewed and submit corrective actions that should be taken to prevent other patients from becoming victim to poor quality of care by Scottsdale Healthcare.  I have attached copies of all bills received. Another experience which is the most dissatisfying to me which was left out of this letter is, the urinary tract specialist that Scottsdale Healthcare's doctor Rosenberg referred me to refused to take my case and submit the urine sample for analyzing.  I literally left the hospital with absolutely no resolution and no explanation of what caused the kidney stones.  Isn't there a law against not helping someone who is hurt and in need?  I received no treatment and no diagnoses and no resolution from Scottsdale Healthcare. Scottsdale Healthcare clearly does not have a metric for measuring quality of service in regards to billing.  I understand if something was accidentally charged the bill may be adjusted, but since this is a service and operational complaint I do not believe they have an unbiased standard for determining if personal care is properly administered to patients.  Throwing papers at people to sign their life away when they feel as if their own life is at risk is not hospitable, it is extortion.  This hospital's malpractice has cost me my reputation with the credit bureaus and numerous other opportunities dependent on credit scores since then, such as financing solar panels for my home, refinancing my home two times had failed to meet a fair price, required down payments on phone bills.\",\n",

       " 'Bought a Dodge Challenger at Towbin Dodge in 2014 and was pressed beyond belief to buy an extended warranty for $2,000 by their obnoxiously pushy finance guy.  He also pressed me to buy the gap coverage and a tire / rim warranty.   I sold this vehicle recently to Carmax (great experience by the way!).  After looking at my paperwork, the helpful person at Carmax informed me that I was entitled to pro-rated rebates on all of these items I\\'d purchased from Towbin Dodge. I went back to Towbin Dodge with all of the paperwork I was given when I bought the car from them and asked their finance dept. to process these refunds.  They quickly picked thru my paperwork and said they\\'d process the gap and wheel warranty refund but they advised me they couldn\\'t help me with the general warranty because I didn\\'t have my actual policy.  I explained this was ALL the paperwork I was given when I bought the car from them.  I\\'ve never removed a single paper from the paperwork they gave me and never had any reason to look through it until now. I asked nicely and repeatedly for them to help me.  I said, \"surely you guys must be able to get me a copy of the policy you sold me for $2,000\".  The finance guy repeatedly said, \"nope, sorry guy - can\\'t help you.\"  I said over and over, \"can\\'t you at least give me the number for the company so I can get it myself\"?  Again, he was completely unhelpful and rude and kept saying no as he walked away.   Thinking quickly, I went into their service department and thought maybe if I trick them into thinking they can get some work out of me, then they might be willing to help me, so I walked up there and showed the guy a copy of my sales contract from 2 years ago.  I showed him the line item for $2,000 that showed I was charged $2,000 by Towbin Dodge for a warranty policy from First Automotive.  I told the guy I needed to get some warranty work done but I misplaced First Automotive\\'s phone number and he then quickly and gladly gave it to me. I called First Automotive and explained that I sold the car and asked what I needed to do get a refund on my warranty.  They said to email them that I was cancelling the policy along with a copy of my odometer disclosure and bill of sale to prove that I sold the car, which I did. After about a month, I called First Automotive back to check on the status of my refund.  They were unable to find any record of me or my warranty that Towbin Dodge supposedly ordered with my $2,000.  Maybe that\\'s why the Towbin Dodge finance guy practically ran away when I asked him to help me with a warranty refund.  Maybe they never ordered it and someone pocketed my money? Maybe they\\'ll be a little nicer and more forthcoming in producing my warranty for the Judge when I file suit.',\n",

Throughout the months leading up to my wedding she was distant and uninvolved. I attempted to engage the owner to get more help however she too was uninterested. Two weeks before my wedding, Lisa quit. She told us on Monday that she was leaving Bliss, and told us she would be available for the next 4 days if we had any questions. I called the owner Tara, who offered minimal assistance. I had our final run through with the venue, DJ, florist the day after she quit. Tara informed me that I should cancel that appointment and reschedule for some time later that week so that the substitute that she had arranged for Lisa could be there. She didn't offer to call anyone or reschedule the meeting herself - despite it being on the books and coordinated for weeks. Finally, after several phone calls Tara allowed us to have a phone meeting to figure out the plan going forward. She offered us one of her staff who had never run a wedding to be our event coordinator that day. We felt that this was strongly inadequate given that the wedding was in 2 weeks and despite our concerns, she did not offer any solution. We had to cancel our contract with them and lost all of the money we had originally paid - even tho Lisa hadn't even done anything! Don't waste your time, money and emotions with Bliss.

It would appear that their customer service was limited to a single group of customers, poor value for their hourly wage times five.  We were seated shortly there after, the decor of the restaurant was quite impressive, service initially started out as quite promising but quickly declined  My theory on this Brazilian styled restaurant is as follows.  I believe they have this down to a science.  Your first offering is quick and efficient with poorer cuts of meat served first.  For reasons unknown and with your disk displaying more, service is non existent, and it only gets worse.  I think they realize that it takes approximately four minutes for your body to realize it's full, so the longer you wait to be served the less you will consume.  We had flagged down the waiter asking why service was so poor and additionally the manager, they in turn will enquire as to which meat you would like, I thought the entire concept was to readily be served 15 different varieties, not specifically one or two upon frustration and request, verbally, defeats the purpose.  The over all quality of flavour and tenderness was poor.  In conclusion for forty four dollars per person, I could get better quality service and food for the equivalent at most moderately priced steak houses.

Our room on the 31st floor seemed like a quick and shoddy cover up of what used to be the Aladdin hotel. The closet door barely hung on its hinges, the walls were scuffed up, and the bathroom was grimy. Not to mention that there was barely any water pressure in the shower.   It was just plain gross and all of a sudden I feel itchy just recalling it.  As if all that wasn't bad enough, housekeeping kept making our bed with sheets that were too short for our king sized bed.  We could feel the exposed mattress at our feet and this occurred again the day after we had to remake the bed ourselves. The front desk would not answer the phone after multiple calls and I suppose something could have been done had we gone to the front desk to raise a stink in person but frankly it wasn't worth the effort.

       " \"As someone that is legally blind and has been wearing glasses and corrective lenses since the age of 7, I have been to countless optometrists/optical stores throughout my 30 years on this earth. At first glance, Optica appears to be a fine establishment with a variety of frames/brands to choose from. However I think I need to get my eyes checked again, because that is far from the truth. I went in there with my girlfriend, who wanted to look at several different frames. The employee that was helping us had an attitude about her wanting to look at several different frames, as if it annoyed him to have to actually do his job and unlock more than one display case. Sending his vexation, she apologized several times to him as he opened up different cases- he didn't reply to her, and just kept silently handing her different frames, which made it very awkward.  We politely asked the employee to put a few frames on hold so we could shop around some more before making a decision. My girlfriend was upset and felt insulted by the poor service. We decided to go to LensCrafters instead, and ended up getting a better deal. I'm not one for supporting big brands/corporations like LensCrafters and try to support smaller businesses like this one, but opted out in this case as their professionalism was sub par and the employees seemed to hate their jobs/lives.  We went in after we were done at LensCrafters, wanting to politely tell the employee that as a result of his attitude we didn't buy the frames- and that hopefully he would improve on his salesperson skills as a result of our humble outcry. He wasn't there (presumably taking a much anticipated lunch break).  Instead, we told another employee that the customer service  experience we received there was poor and that we were generally disappointed, to which he replied with a blank stare 'I'm sorry to hear that', followed by an awkward silence. Seeing that he generally didn't care either, we walked out.  It's too bad Optica, we were prepared to buy more than one frame and potentially come back for more in the future. As a result of your lackluster staff, you're losing out on thousands of dollars.\",\n",

My fella suggested Fuku Burger, but I was adament about my noodle craving so we ended up here. I ordered the spicy noodle and my fella got the duck fried rice. I also ordered a Thai tea for good measure. The tea was overly sweet and way too creamy. I handed that to my fella to finish. Next came our noodles. They weren't nearly as spicy and the texture was a little slimey. I wasn't a fan of that. My fella's fried rice was dry and really lacked flavor.

       " 'Hallo,  wir waren vor kurzem im \"Class\", um eine andere Kultur kennenzulernen. Leider ist das doch gänzlich in die Hose gegangen. Warum? Mehr dazu im Text:  Es ist für die Raucher sicherlich interessant, dass im Betrieb geraucht werden darf. Das ist auch brav unterteilt, nur leider ist es egal wo man sitzt, der klaffende Qualm kommt irgendwann auch zu den Nichtrauchern.. Aber von vorne :-)  Wir waren mit mehreren Personen im Laden, darunter auch Raucher und ein Ex-Raucher. Auf Grund dessen sassen wir natürlich an einem \"Rauchertisch\", man möchte die Raucher ja nicht diskriminieren.  Beim betreten des Ladens war es dem Ex-Raucher bereits aufgefallen, dass es direkt an der Eingangstür schon etwas nach Zigarette roch. Es wurde dann brav am Kochbereich vorbei gegangen und der zugewiesene Tisch besetzt.  Leider mussten wir hier schon feststellen, dass eine der dort genutzen Glasoberflächen die auf den Tischdecken liegen, defekt war. Ein Fest für Freunde blutiger Kunst, denn hier war es mehr als gefährlich zu sitzen. Wir hatten das Glück, dass wir nicht in 7 sondern 5 köpfiger Besetzung den Abend verbracht haben, so war zumindest die Gefahr einer Verletzung erstmal nicht gegeben.  Es viel auch im Raucherbereich sofort die sehr, sehr schlechte Luft auf. Die Wandteppiche sind Zeugnisse durchqualmter Nächte und sehen auch nicht frisch aus.  Die Truppe hat das vorerst mal so hingenommen. Dann ging es an ein paar Bestellungen, Getränke, nichts ungewöhnliches. Weißwein Schorle, Spezi.. Es viel auf, dass die Karten leider aussen dreckig waren, Saucenflecken etc. nicht gerade der Brüller, aber verschmerzbar.  Eine Dame des Tisches suchte dann auch irgendwann die Frischmach-Räumlichkeiten auf, entgegnete dann bei der Rückkehr, dass diese leider dreckig und unaufgeräumt seien. Kann ich mir bei orientalischen Restaurants kaum vorstellen, ist doch bei dieser Kultur die Reinlichkeit oberstes Gebot.  Die Getränke kamen, wir bestellten eine Vorspeisenplatte.. Leider waren z.B. Röllchen mit Schafskäsefüllung bereits aus.. Wir erhielten hier dann eine Platte, mit verschiedenen Pasten und ein paar Gurken- und Tomatenscheiben. Die Pasten waren geschmacklich auf ganz gutem Niveau, der Schafskäse leider nicht. Fühlte sich an wie Tofu, die Konsistenz ebenfalls, Geschmacklich nicht wirklich hohes Niveau. Es wurde kaltes Fladenbrot gereicht, nachgefüllt wurde nicht.  In der Zwischenzeit bauten eifrige Helfer für den Abend Boxen und Musikanlagen auf, laut Information des Lokals sollte ab ca. 23 Uhr eine Band spielen, wir waren also gespannt (es war 20.30 Uhr) ob dies dann auch so sein sollte :-)  Ein junger Kellner wollte dann, während wir speisten, doch rasch die Teller wegräumen, die noch gefüllt waren.. Das war der erste negative Punkt an den Kellnern an diesem Abend.  Wir wollten dann natürlich unsere Hauptspeisen bestellen, der Kellner kam auch zu uns, unterhielt sich während der Bestellung aber mit dem Nachbartisch, der zweite negative Punkt an den Kellnern. Der Höhepunkt war aber, dass ausser der Beilage \"Reis\" keinerlei andere Beilage wählbar war, es läge am Luftabzug, auf Grund dessen Einstellung könne man nicht frittieren etc.. Für mich eine Lachplatte sondersgleichen :-)  Wir sassen nun geschlagene 65 Minuten rum, mit unseren Getränken bis uns der Kellner entgegnete, dass ja jetzt so viele Personen da seien und wir bitte Geduld mit dem Essen haben sollten, das geschah aber erst auf Rückfrage von uns :-)  Lustigerweise waren zur Zeit unserer Bestellung noch nicht so viele Leute da (Lokal ca. zur Hälfte gefüllt), in der Zwischenzeit kamen aber 1x 20 - 25 und 1x 10 - 15 neue Gäste an große Tische.  Dummerweise fingen nun alle im Lokal mit Rauchen an, die Luft konnte mit einem Messer geschnitten werden, wir hatten immernoch nicht unser Essen. Zu allem Überfluss fing die Band bereits um 21.30 Uhr mit dem Spielen der Musik an. Diese war so laut, das normale Kommunikation ohne richtiges Schreien nicht mehr möglich war. Ebenfalls wurde das Licht abgeschalten, die ausgeschloschenen Teelichter wurden leider auch nicht erneuert oder wieder angezündet.  Nachdem unsere Nichtraucher und Ex-Raucher bereits beinah kollabierten auf Grund der Luft, haben wir dann nach 75 Minunten ohne Essen, dieses storniert.. Es wäre wohl gerade fertig gewesen, die Herren hätten es uns auch eingepackt, so dass wir es hätten mitnehmen können. Wir haben dankend abgelehnt und die Lokation mit wirklicher Freude und Erleichterung verlassen.  Alles in allem ein sehr schlechter Abend, schlechte Gastgeber, persönlich fühlte ich mich immer beobachtet, im Vergleich zu den anderen Gästen auch minderwertig behandelt. Wir waren dahergehend mehr als enttäuscht, einer unserer Mitbegleiter hatte den Betrieb vor 2 Wochen erst besucht und in den Himmel gelobt.  Wir sind dann in eine andere Lokation, ein Grieche, ebenfalls mit Raucherplätzen, eingekehrt. Hier im Raucherbereich aber frische Luft, alles Super, so wie wir es uns im \"Class\"',\n",
       " 'This shop is the worst shop I have ever been too. I went there a couple weeks ago because I had a check engine light on. It was P0171 O2 sensor code, bank one too lean. The manager, well i assumed he was the manager. He was way too fat to be a mechanic told me it would be an hour or so. He called me a while later telling me the sensor was bad told me the cost and how long it would take. I agreed. They did it. I got it, the code was gone so I drove on my way. About a mile down the road the Check Engine light came back on. I was already late so I went back the next day. Guess what, code P0171 was back. He said he would troubleshoot it. He then came back and said that it was the Mass air flow sensor. I was a little more leery this time but I needed this to get done. They changed it out. Picked up the car got about half way home guess what happened. Yep, the check engine light came on again. I was really pissed now. I took it to a real mechanic. He had it for about 20 minutes came back with my old fuel filter and said that it was clogged. He said all he did was hooked up his fuel pressure tester and checked that. It was really low so he pulled out the old one put in a new one and did the test again. Passed with flying colors!  Seriously, DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOP!!!',\n",

We should have been wise and not bothered when we only saw a few people in the restaurant for dinner. There seem to be only a chinese lady(I think the owners wife) working all aspects of the restaurant.  She was taking orders, getting drinks, cleaning table, etc.  She was all over the place which had us waiting.  Needless to say the serve was extremely poor.  The food we ordered was even worst.  No flavor, no taste.  One of our crispy fish dishes was not crispy and was very soft.  We told her the problem but she didn't care.  Please save your money and go somewhere else.

I was very pleased with the initial encounter with scheduling and having the first appointment (Thursday 7/13) to diao my AC. I was quoted $800 for a part I was originally told was covered by the manufacture since the unit was just installed (By others) earlier this year. The next day (Friday 7/14) I received a call that the part was in stock and y'all could be there to complete the repair that day from 10-2. Great! I had already ordered a new completed blower assembly ($379.07 & $270.77 shipping) for my unit as a backup plan but was able to call and cancel the order and was willing to pay the extra money to have it done by George Brazil since the part I ordered wouldn't arrive until Monday. An hour or so later I received a call from the tech that was at my house from the day before claiming he was on his way to get the part and would then meet me at the house he then started asking if anyone had contacted me about the price. There was nothing mentioned about the price being anything different from the quote I received the day before  when I was called to schedule the appointment. He then proceed to explain to me the part would not be covered by the manufacture and the cost would be a little over $2,000.00. After some conversation I declined to proceed with the services due to such a significant increase on a part that cost less than $200 (The blower module was the only thing being replaced). There is a happy ending though...I was able to call the place I had cancelled the order from and not only were they able to still get it shipped out right away they also agreed for $20.00 extra to have it delivered on Saturday (7/15). So for $150.16 LESS than the original amount I was quoted and 45 minutes of my time I was able to replace the ENTIRE BLOWER ASSEMBLY!

I was specifically interested in my a/c unit. It would work well under 85 degrees, but once the temperature outside went above this, my a/c would no longer work. I let them take my beauty in the back, and watched from afar as it was put up on the lift. They were the professionals after all, and would take good care of my car.  I waited in the lobby, and just sort of stood by out of the way. The man who appeared to be the manager (no name tag) was talking to men and they all seemed to be having a fun conversation. This was until I overheard the employee ask one of the men about his line of work. They were both bouncers at a club on the Strip. The next question was 'what was the craziest thing they have ever been a witness to during their job'? I was right there, and became very uncomfortable listening to this. The guys went into very graphic detail about the 'craziest thing' they had seen. I am all for guys talking 'guy talk', but I was in a place of business, and they had my car on the lift. I was not feeling very happy about them having my keys at this point. I left the lobby, and headed outside while they continued their conversation. After a short time, I was presented with my estimate of repairs. I was shocked at the prices. They were higher than any I have seen in a very long time. Some items did need to be addressed fairly soon, while others just seemed a bit too much. It was as if they wanted to bring my car back to new when it rolled off of the showroom floor. It is an 11 year old car. After all of that, they did not even address my a/c question. Said it was a compressor. I reiterated that it works just fine below 85 degrees, that it has something to do with the outside temperature. This is where I received a blank look. No further suggestions were offered. I took my estimate, and asked to get my car back.  I went outside to wait for my car, and as the employee opened the door to let me get into my car I noticed all of the grease on the inside of my car! I just had my car detailed, and it was spotless when I drove it in for the inspection. I am SO glad that I had an extra floor mat over my expensive ones, otherwise he would have ruined them. There was grease all over the floor. I was furious. Don't they put down paper mats, and take care of people's vehicles? Obviously not here. I went inside and told the manager (again, I am unsure of his title, as he was not wearing a name tag) to look at what had happened. As I was in the lobby, I noticed yet another employee with grease ALL OVER his arms and hands. He was on the phone, in the front lobby like this. No wonder there was grease all over my car, as they apparently don't know how to keep themselves clean. I was so incredibly disappointed with my experience here. I was uncomfortable with the unprofessional atmosphere in the lobby, and then very upset when my very clean car was returned to me with grease everywhere.

About 10 minutes later the ladies arrived and started the massage. The place is small and there were another 2 gentleman there. The place had some music on, and an older gentleman who was probably the owner's husband was watching TV, loudly...I put on my headphones and tried to listen to some music, but it was kind of hard to tune out the snores from a customer, the music coming from the speakers AND a TV. The massage was actually very good, but the situation was very uncomfortable. When the massage was over, we asked the lady if she had the number for a Taxi service, she said she will call the taxi for us, which was very nice of her. She called the taxi in front of us and to be honest, it was very difficult to understand her, she gave the taxi driver very complicated directions. 20 minutes later, no taxi. 30 minutes later, no taxi. We asked her if she could please just give us the number and we will call and she refused. She called the taxi back and started arguing over the phone. we kept seeing a parade of taxis pass by and we told her that we would just go outside and get on a random cab, she got super mad and blocked the door so we wouldn't leave, saying the taxi was on it's way. After being there for 45 minutes (inside since she wouldn't let us go outside) a taxi came by (it was 10 PM at this point) she finally opened the door and let us go outside, as it turns out, that was not our taxi but a taxi driver who came to get a massage. She asked us to go back inside and we refused, we called a cab that was on the red light and he came to pick us up, she lady was super upset and started following us asking us not to get on that cab.

We arrived promptly and ordered wine and 2 appetizers and our entrees. The appetizers and bread arrived relatively promptly and were good.   Around 5:50 our waiter said our entrees would be right out at about the same time he brought entrees to the table next to us and had to take 1 back and he didn't reappear for 10-15 minutes.  At about 6:05 we the asked him about our entrees and he said he would go and check and he never returned. I went and found the manager about 10 minutes later and told him we had theater tickets and did not have time for the entrees and he seemed surprised and explained they had been hit by a crowd all at once and that was why service was slow.  He offered to comp the appetizers and wanted to know if anything else was wrong.   I really did not know how to answer.  We sat for over an hour, never got our entrees, our waiter wasn't really attentive.  The restaurant seemed surprised that the people attending the theater all arrived at one time despite the fact this happens 5 or 6 nights a week.   I truly do not understand how a restaurant that caters to a theater crowd can be so unaware of the time constraints of their clientele\",\n",

I called Dream back and inquired how much it would cost to get an acrylic fill with 5 broken nails and the lady on the phone told me $33. Once I told her what I had been charged she passed me on to talk to the manager. The manager asked me to bring in my bank statement. I went into Dream with my bank statement and waited to talk to the manager. The aesthetician who had done my nails told the manager I got my nails removed and had a full set put back on, which I hadn't.

Anyways, the food was cold when it came out to me. It was disgusting. The beef was cold, the tempura was cold, and altogether this joint just doesn\\'t deserve the 4.5 stars it has.

Let\\'s put it this way, if it were 1865 and John Wilkes Booth and Abraham Lincoln were in this theater together, Booth might had shot Criss Angel, instead of Abe Lincoln, changing the course of history.     Chris has re-worked his show with much fanfare...or maybe with a few fair fans. The theater 4/13/11 was about 1/3 empty. ThankfulIy, I was there with comp tics.  Really Criss? your still using that fake banner bit at the beginning of the show. \"Oh you made that for me?\" Really?\" Um, no, Criss, I made the one directing people to any other show but yours, but security nabbed that one from me at the door.   Most of the original and very creative cirque videos, costumes and live bits are gone. Most of any Cirque element is history. This must be the same damn magic show he\\'s been doing since his  bar mitzvah gig days. Hey Chris, disappearing once or twice is enough, 10-12 times is overkill pal. Oh, and can we have more videos at your LIE(ve) performance. Fans love paying a hundred bucks or so to watch some damn videos. Video killed the magic star.   During those dead spots where applause is normally expected, Chris still gets very little. With the new amped up show they cover those dead spots with additional loud sound effects and I swear maybe even some fake applause. It helps mask the genuine ambivalence the audience has for Criss. It\\'s hard to clap when you have that \"holy shit I have been completely ripped off\" feeling in your stomach. If your thinking about going to this show, hope that John Wilkes Booth rises from his grave and attends too, maybe he\\'ll put you out of your misery before Angel makes you want to kill yourself for spending so much money for such a blah show. Lastly, the show is a basic magic show. I would give it 3 stars if ticket prices were around $30-$50. For around $100 bucks this show is still a coplete rip off. I really don\\'t know how Criss can sleep at night. Oh wait, yes I do, with pillows full of YOUR money under his sleepy head.',\n",
       " 'I usually find a lot more redeeming qualities to a place. However, Saddle Mountain Brewing Co. was a disappointment. We did not eat in, but had take out a few days ago. We had the Jalapeno bombers, Fish and chips, and the Rachel sandwich. The bombers are plain jalapenos that are stuffed with sausage and have cheese. They are supposed to come with an avocado aioli but we did not get any. They were a bit greasy from the sausage but were ok although not the traditional finger food we are used to. We had to use forks. The fish and chips were also just so so. The filet was a little thin and the fish was ok but not the \"cod white\" that I expected. The problem was that the batter coating was a little too done and hard to bite into, not a crunchy mouth feel. The fries were only so so and not very memorable. There was ketchup and mustard packets provided but they had something on them that smelled like someone had sprayed it with room freshner.  I imagine some cleaner of some sort got spilled on the items. So we didn\\'t bother with them. The absolute worst part of the meal was the cole slaw. I\\'ve never had bland, tasteless coleslaw in my life until now. It seemed to be made with just a little watered down mayonnaise. It was dry and honestly had little or no flavor. It had no tang or any sweetness (depending on the style you like). It really did nothing positive for the sandwich. Unfortunately the slaw was also on top of the Rachel Sandwich. The sandwich just wasn\\'t very good.  We always want juicy, succulent pastrami and this was very, very dry. The bun was a basic pretzel bun but there was almost no sauce and nothing else to give the sandwich any flavor. A good mustard would have really helped. Since we didn\\'t order any beer, I can\\'t give any information on those. But we probably won\\'t ever go there for food again.

       " 'I am so frustrated with this chain restaurant. I\\'ve been there several times as I like to walk to dinner and it is within walking distance. Protein quantities are slim and fat seems high. I order triple chicken on a salad and still am only given what other good restaurants would offer as one serving of chicken. A serving of tomatoes on a salad was about six halves of cherry tomatoes.  The red onion was equivalent to a loosely packed tablespoon.  They are super modest with their ingredients, except for the fatty or sweet sauces.  I\\'m not sure if the honey-cilantro dressing really has honey as it is SO sweet... It tastes like corn syrup.  My order has been made wrong several times and seems to get mixed up with other people\\'s food (coming down the disorganized food line), as workers grab as several different items with their hands, asking me what I had for the second or, usually, a third time, before pulling food off of the line and ringing it up.  One time, I even asked the worker to write down my order as I make a few modifications, and he did not (he memorized it instead), and still, it was wrong.  The process from ordering to paying is disorganized and requires that one keep a close eye on their food, then hustle out of the line as lines behind come through the register (which has limited space for the size of the trays).   I have been undergoing the extensive process of learning to eat healthy for personal health reasons and suspect that this chain is coming off of my healthy food list.  I do not eat out often but decided to try this place and learn about their food/ingredients/nutrition in the process.  I pay attention to food sources, fillers, preservatives, and quality of ingredients as much as I do calories/macronutrients.  Twice I have asked for nutritional info. The first time, an employee told me they \"didn\\'t have them for 2017, yet\".  The look on her face seemed as though there was something more she wasn\\'t saying.  The second time, I spoke to the general manager, she said they don\\'t provide nutritional info but she could guide me through making a \"healthy\" selection. I told her that I feel cautious of restaurants that don\\'t provide nutrition info and I can\\'t tell if their soup is 300 calories in a serving or 1000 calories (a serving, as in one cup/8 oz.). She, in her own words, told me that the chain was not going to provide nutritional info until required by law, but that she understood my frustration. HUGE RED FLAG that this restaurant (the higher up corporation) is hiding something!!!  Even in looking at their food sources on the main website, they try to persuade the viewer that the food is from a \"healthy\" source. There is no commitment or label of USDA organic or non-GMO, which places them in category of \" ???\" and probably not as healthy as one would hope.  Not that this us unusual in the fast or restaurant food industry... I was disappointed to see a place that could be \"healthy\" hiding information from consumers. My experience at your restaurant last night felt dishonest and misleading. My $$$ is going elsewhere until I know what I\\'m eating.  I would not recommend this place for people with food allergies or for those who are trying to be nutrient-conscious.

The summer rolls were a huge disappointment - dry chicken, too much noodles, ZERO flavor. The only thing we could taste was the plum sauce, which let's be honest was a really WEIRD condiment choice. It completely overpowered the dry chicken and bland noodles, and the overall effect was not a terrible flavor combination. Nonethless, they were *technically* edible, and I ate them. Good thing too, as the Pad Thai was revolting and tasted basically like a chicken-flavored lollipop. With every sickly sweet bite I lamented the absence of nuttiness and savory tang - the normal province of a Pad Thai. I pushed away most of my half portion.

We waited another HOUR for that to happen before we finally asked them to bring us back our cat and we left. Completely unsatisfactory service. A vet who seemed like she just got out of school. An extremely high bill. We won't be back any time soon.\",\n",
       " \"I wish there were negative stars for this Pep Boys store!!!! I was there this past Saturday, April 9th.  Was greeted very unfriendly by Caleb.  I went in to get Freon added to my a/c system.  My appointment was for 11:00.  My car was not brought into a stall until 11:30 and then another tech came to tell me that rather than just add the Freon, they would like to do an inspection to find out where the problem is in my a/c system.  I informed them that I already know where the problem is, I was told last year by my regular mechanic that my compressor is bad but that to replace that is going to be very expensive.  My car is a 2000, I don't want to invest that kind of money into something I won't have much longer.  They insisted that for $34.95 I could get a second opinion and check for an a/c hose leak and basically insisted that they do this before they could or would add Freon to my car.  I unhappily agreed and asked how much longer this would take and was told 30 mins.  An hour and a half later, no one has come to give me any answers so I go up front and they say they are just inputting the technicians' results into the computer.  Sure enough, my a/c compressor is bad. Really? I told them that from the very beginning so it cost me $39.95 to tell them what was wrong with my car and then, on top of that, they want $189.00 to add Freon.  Needless to say, I left with no Freon and $40.00 poorer but Caleb acted like they did me a favor by vacuuming out my a/c motor.  Gee, thanks!!! Oh, and the GM, Deborah, all I saw her do for the entire 2 hours I was there, is stand outside, smoke. I guess I need to do my research on Yelp before bringing my vehicle to any mechanic!!!!\",\n",

We tried the spring rolls, several of the vegetable dishes, fried rice, shrimp, cocktail sauce, crab legs, salads, desserts... basically gave everything a try. The spring rolls and crackers were chewy, while all the sauces were inedible. The cocktail sauce had such a strong horseradish taste that I nearly choked on it, and I'm not sure what was in the Caesar dressing but it was awful and had a weird, gritty texture (almost like sand). My dining partner said the desserts were very good.  The saving grace for dinner was the make your own pasta bar. It was something that I easily could have made at home, but it was fresh, tasty, and the only reason that I left feeling full.

The first impression while getting out of the car wasn't very good--the sound of dogs constantly barking reminded us of a shelter. We get that dogs bark, but the sound was visibly stressful to our dog as we brought her in.  I brought her back to the kennel with a male staff member. The kennel she was staying in still had feces from the previous dog staying there and the overwhelming smell of urine was enough to give anyone a headache. The beds that owners brought in were on top of the kennels, so it made me wonder if they ever used them. I asked if there are beds available for us to put the blankets on that we brought for her. She's an old dog and has arthritis, so we do our best to keep her comfortable. He said they've been busy and haven't had the time to put them out. When I asked the receptionist at the front desk, she said they had no beds available. After I brought up that their website stated that a bed is included with standard boarding, she asked if our dog will chew up the bed. Is that really the impression that they have about people's dogs? Don't provide a bed unless asked even if it's advertised that it's included? Just the interactions with these two staff members alone made us upset.  Another thing I noticed was that they're always indoors. Unless you pay for daycare, chances are your dog wouldn't go outside. The run portion is still indoors. They don't go outside! We asked them if we can pick her up on her last day (Sunday) just a little after 6pm, which is when they close. Our return flight lands at 5:30pm and we were willing to pay a late fee to get her. They said they don't do after hours pick up because no one will be available, even though the owner lives next door.  Unfortunately, we didn't have any other choice but to have her stay there because of the trip we had planned and the holiday weekend limiting availability of other boarding facilities. When we finally picked her up at my Dad's house (we asked him to get her one day early), she was whining/crying. My dad mentioned that he fed her when they got home, despite her separated baggies of food being empty.  We took her home to do an inspection of her body. The most noticeable area was the redness along her underside when we laid her on her back. We started to wonder if she even slept on the bed & blankets at all or if she was on the cement the whole time. The backside of her front legs were even raw from irritation. We gave her another bath at home because the complimentary bath had a chemical smell that was disturbing. Overall, never taking her back here again.

The customer service, no communication and NO follow-up from supposedly a management team at both the Front Row and Denver Mattress from the time I ordered my bedroom and mattress to the time it was delivered and recognizing that the bed ordered lack some pieces to NO mattress pulled from the warehouse to accompany the bed was absolutely horrible. No follow through, nor any respect for the customer.  The bed was delivered on Wednesday, June 26, with  no Mattress (From Denver Mattress).  The order was no pulled correctly. Likewise, while assembling the bed the delivery guy noticed that that items needed to assembly the bed were incomplete and call the store, Front Row , to let them know and no one called to apologize and have to call as of today, Friday, June 28, to confirm a replacement for the missing pieces. Denver Mattress was an absolutely a \"NO STAR\", the assistant Manager, Marcus, was totally rambling, lack professionalism and obviously had no sense of customer training and follow through. The delivery guy called him immediately to inform Marcus that my mattress was not pulled from the warehouse and he (Marcus) indicated that he would call me, he never called so an hour later while the delivery guys were still at my place I called him and proceeded to tell me he had been on vacation, etc, just rambling offering no solution to the customer, completely irresponsible and lack any knowledge of how to respond to a crisis situation and became to familiar with his language with speaking to me a customer. Till this day no one from the management team at Front Row Furniture or Denver Mattress including management has called to follow-up and apologize nor offer any resolution. The delivery guy from Front Row went out of his way to do whatever he could although he nothing to do with the initial order, pulling the order and or providing a solution for the bed or mattress. However, he did without authorization get back in his truck after assembling the bed as is and went to the warehouse and took it upon himself to pull a mattress.  Although my the missing parts for the bed still remain unassembled. Again, the manager, Ryan at Front Row as yet to return my call about my bed to provide any replacement date, etc and Marcus at Denver Mattress did not even follow up with me to ensure that received the mattress although he had absolutely nothing to do with providing a solution or other options to resolve the initial mattress delivery that include \"no\" mattress on my initial delivery. As an executive that deals with brands, I would not recommend this company b/c the customer service, communications and ability to handle and resolve serious issues is bar none very very low. Absolutely, I would not purchase from this store again. Mr. Young-Lewis',\n",

When you sit in a car hop space or idle in the drive thru line you can often observe 4-5-6 workers congregated near the register chit-chatting, drinking, watching, texting and hanging out... not actively engaged in food or order prep... it can be very frustrating.  This is one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever been in (consistently) and it often prompts us to pull in to a space and order via the drive-up screen.  Tonight, we pulled into a space, facing the building and watched as the employees were hanging out, talking drinking their drinks, texting and not being the least bit productive or service oriented.  EVEN if half of them were waiting on food to be readied for delivery, not one of them could break free to deliver an order that was ONLY a drink? THEN... to make matters worse, they delivered the wrong drink.  This is not the first time, sadly.  I had my hands full, so, until I got home and unloaded the vehicle, did I decide to take a sip.  We were given SWEEEEET TEA, when we repeatedly said... REGULAR TEA, UNSWEETENED TEA, NO SUGAR, and were then called upon to acknowledge the order on the screen.  Additionally, the order receipt specifies UNSWEETENED TEA. I called the Manager, Robert... and don't have the least bit of confidence that he was really engaged in the call.  He even challenged me to get the receipt to verify that I had told the truth, that the order was for UNSWEETENED TEA (CHK 451).  I had already told him we were home, in our jammies and were parked in the last available space, unable to return to correct SONIC'S error and pick up another order that they will continue to go back and forth with, over and over, do I want SWEET or UNSWEETENED... regular or ICED TEA or what.  EVERY single time we come there we specify that we want it regular, unsweetened and no sugar and again get asked the same series of questions that are routinely disregarded.  Some nights the drive through wait is well over 20 minutes for only a few cars.  During this time we see 4, 5, or 6 kids in the front area, hanging out. ~HUGE FAIL~  This happens when ordering a drink or meals and drinks.  The propensity of employees to question, re-question and not listen when asking the question or prompting for the order is not OK.  If you are taking an order, pay attention.  Your employees are NOT gifted at multi-tasking on any level.  What they end up doing is piss poor on all fronts.\",\n",

       " 'let me begin by talking true racism and unethical medical pratices, i came to this office because i was referred by a family member , so i went in with my sister to see Dr. Jenny Rau, we came in to see if i can get a check-up and see if a medical ceritficate can be issues if i am ok to fly overseas , i am currently 32 weeks pregnant. we confirmed with them numerous times what would be the right procedure to get a ceritifcate (we dont mind if they said yes or no , with whatever they find and if they think i was unfit  to fly), so we left since they said we should be able to fly under 36 weeks with no problem, but when we got home and checked the website for cathay pacific they required a medical certificate if you are at 27 weeks and 6 days. so i received a miss call the next morning and called back and was directed to the office manager NICOLE W. and she started going off that our intentions are wrong and how we refused to pay 1600 for the visit (when all we did was clarify how much would a wellness visit be) and that we are not going to jeoperdize their practice and how we are trying to trick them to sign a document and end up being liable if anything happens, and that (here goes) YOU CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THIS IN THIS COUNTRY... and i was in shock when being attacked that way and how she had witnesses on the trouble we did at the doctors office the day before and she has witnesses, i was appalled because this was all false, my sister has been seeing the the last 3 years  and how they made that judgement call surpised us. then she said you sound like your smart and you know what you are doing so you should know how this works, what got me was i am not the doctor here i am a patient that is why the past month a half i called to clarify these things because \" I AM NOT A DOCTOR\" money is not an object we dont mind paying if we have to , if i am not able to fly and will ahve to deliver here that is fine, i am a cash paying patient and have no intention of using any state medical assistance of payment plans with them if the time came i would have to deliver in phoenix. Then Nicole goes off i cant keep repeating myself this conversation is over and hangs up. so i have consulted with my sisters attorney and we are filing a complaint against them with the az medical board and the attoney general .  on the brighter side we spoke with arrowhead oby gyn and they will gladly accept us and make any assesment possible, and they are going to take me in this afternoon with no problems so we can make any necessary arrangements if a flight needs to be cancelled. i am disappointed with what happened , you would think educated individuals would handle the situation better and in a more professional manner. all she had to do was take a breathe and approach the situation , i think being condescending is not the way to solve a problem.  i hope all can understand where we are coming from , i felt like a 90 mph fast ball came at me out of nowhere, and all we wanted to to was ask what would be a good idea and they just started making biased conclusions against me. no my sister was always wondering why their waiting area is so empty and the carpets has black spots all over the place , i guess their priority is geared more on to bullying patients more than anything.',\n",

About a third of the way down I saw a dime coin in my soup.

I asked for the owner and the owner came out and said \"I cooked the soup and we don\\'t have any money back there.\" I felt EXTREMELY offended that both the owner and the waiter were insisting that they weren\\'t going to take responsibility for the dime coin being in the soup. So I told the owner that I wished she would take some form of responsibility because I too did not know how the dime made it into the soup.  She didn\\'t want to cooperate so I said well \"I\\'m not going to pay for the pad thai either because you are not being apologetic and you are offending me and my sister because it sounds like you are accusing us.\" Next, the owner yelled and said \"Fine, don\\'t pay for anything, leave, and don\\'t come back!\" We then gathered our things and left. On our way out I wanted a business card and they didn\\'t have any.  In the end I gave them $12 for the pad thai but this was all while they were yelling at my offended sister and the owner threw the money back at my sister. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE OWNER MADE US LOOK AND FEEL AS IF WE PURPOSELY PUT THE COIN IN THE SOUP. If the owner would have apologized and taken responsibility then that would have been that but instead they accused my sister and I of trying to get a $7.75 soup for free.

No product was put in it at all for shine or hold, the top wasn't flat ironed or anything to smooth it over so it had random kinks and waves all over, making it look like I just threw it up quick myself. Both time when I left the salon and was driving home, the hair started falling out! If it fell out driving home I can't imagine what would have happened during my busy wedding day.

We received our order and it wasn\\'t at all appetizing. My side salad was wilted and my husband\\'s sandwich was soggy.

There is usually always one thing about a restaurant that is redeeming, but for this particular restaurant, on this particular visit, I could not find one.  To be fair, I did visit one hour before closing, which gives some reason for the behavior that I witnessed, but certainly does not excuse it. I ordered the two meat combo, brisket, pulled pork with bbq beans and fired okra sides.  The first issue I had with the meat was the temperature.  Both items were room temperature at best.  They had both been over cooked, or at a minimum kept in a hot box way too long.  They had lost texture and were short on flavor.  The beans and okra were also disappointing.  The beans were a failed attempt of spicing up canned pork-n-beans.  The okra was frozen and the only flavor was of used fryer grease.  The roll that was served with the meal was quite a surprise.  It actually tasted like the plastic bag it was stored in.  This was a very disappointing meal from start to finish. The real kicker of this experience was the staff.  There were three employees present when I visited.  A young man and woman working the front kitchen area and a slightly older male working in the back.  The older of the three seemed to be serving in some type of \"lead\" position based on him commanding the other two to complete various chores.  As the trio were cleaning up the restaurant, the \"lead\" person in the back could be heard cursing out into the dinning room and making disparaging comments about the restaurant.  He was telling the other two to \"turn the f-ing open sign off,\" we are \"closing this bitch down early.\" \"Who wants to take some of this f-ing food home?\"  One of the employees came over to our table several different times to inquire if we would be getting any soda, tea, ice cream, additional sauce, as he was wanting to turn off and clean these machines.

It is common courtesy to tip the people but it is NOT mandatory. I always tip about 15% everywhere if the service meets the standards and more if everything is better than standards. One rule that applies to everybody is that YOU DON\\'T ASK FOR TIP WITH A DEMANDING ATTITUDE !     More importantly , YOU DON\\'T CURSE AT YOUR CUSTOMER , if he can\\'t tip you for only one time !!  I was shocked first and i only slammed the door but i feel like everybody needs to knows this attitude. Shame on you for treating a loyal customer this way and this was my last order with them.  After i close the door, i got so pissed at myself for not saying anything back because i was shocked...and I couldn\\'t even enjoy my  $50 dollars worth of food.. Also Dragon pearl should be ashamed of having an employee like this ! In the customer service business, your employee always represents your company. Big company, small company doesn\\'t matter.

They were clearly understaffed but we didn't mind the wait; upon close inspection of all their ice cream flavors I spotted a DEAD COCKROACH on top of the strawberry ice cream. I was so disgusted I wanted to just walk out but seeing that the guy behind the counter didn't even notice it I had to point it out. He apologized and took the bucket of ice cream out then continued to serve the next customer.

We waited for 40 minutes until the manager came to say that there is no more salmon and two plates we ordered had to be changed. She brought a menu first we noticed it was one plate so my husband chose a different meal. Then the waitress come along confused saying that there was no more salmon I had told her yes we were told she then mentioned well did the manager told you that you can change the salmon to tilapia. We were shocked because we were not mentioned that. Then we continued to wait until the manager comes out again saying no there is a second plate that has salmon you can change it to tilapia. We continued to wait at this time most of the table were empty on drinks so the waitress comes along and took 20 minutes to come back with drinks Finally after waiting for so long our food is ready. Everyone received their plates except my dad. I told the waitress the plate you are holding is my dad she looked at me confused and called the manager I then mentioned the same thing and the manager was trying to solve who plate it was until they realized that my dad was the only one left with no plate (REALLY). During the time we were eating the drinks did not get refilled once we were done that's when the waitress comes over asking if we wanted more drinks.

When she reminded them that most people operate on a twice monthly salary and they have yet to expect payment for the month the girl muttered something at her and and sarcastically said 'Ok, that's fine.' She talked to her doctor about the girl's attitude and her loud discussion of something private, that should be dealt with away from other hearing ears. He agreed with her and promised something would be done. Well apparently he did not, because she has just received a past due notice AND another bill saying she is 60 days late with her payment and that she now owes about sixty dollars more in late fees. However, my mother has a bank statement showing that they indeed received payment over TWO WEEKS AGO! On the past due statement, there is a little note about disregarding it if 10 days have not passed since the payment was sent. Well she sent her payment on the sixth, and they didn't send the statement until the 19th! That's well past ten days! That's THREE days they had to look at the payment and see that it was there, but instead they sent us this, asking for more money that's not even theirs! I have had it!

I told the manager, that there was no reason for him to behave in that manner to which she just stood quietly which in my opinion even though she was polite in her communication, by not asking the security person to tone it down, was encouraging this kind of a behavior.   Then, the lady told me that someone will come with an incident report form and I can file my report in that form.  As expected, Adrian interjected with his 2 cents again and said that we should just wait there as they might take a couple of hours to arrive with the form.  Clearly, a man who was either drunk, or not in control of his words.  When we were making an incident report, Adrian handed me the form, had a pen in his hand stood there looking the other way. I had to ask him twice to hand me the pen to write the incident down.  Not a big deal, but just goes to show the kind of people that are in charge of security at this place. Well , all in all this incident was enough for me pen this experience down for this hotel since you can expect absolutely harrowing experience if for any reason you happen to deal with hotel staff and security for any reason.',\n",

I don't know if there's been a change in ownership or staff but tonight's experience was terrible.  The server was not engaged with us or the other guests.  She seemed annoyed and bothered to even try decent customer service.  Had to ask for our water 3 times and a glass for our beer twice.  The vegetable tray wasn't as abundant as before and the attention to detail that used to be apparent is now missing.  While we were eating one of the staff members decided to start cleaning the counter tops where our neighboring customers had just finished eating.  Normally this is a good thing, but tonight it went wrong when the employee decided over spray her cleaning chemical into my wife's drink.  Didn't say anything only because she didn't even notice it happening....disappointing.

She says that I don't deserve a refund, but the reality is that an honest person would refund every participant of that challenge IN FULL because she did not fulfill any of the promises she made. Having spoken to several participants of the challenge, I have learned that none of them received any communications about it and NO prizes were ever awarded.

We ordered the family dinner A with egg drop soup, chicken fried rice, orange and sesame chicken (the kids like fried chicken) to go.  Experience ordering and getting our food was great,  we were off to a great start and had high hopes for the food and we were hungry. Got home unpacked the bag and we were missing our egg rolls and crab rangoons, ok we though, we will get them next time we go back (receipt did list them, so they just missed packing them probably).  The orange and sesame chicken were decent and edible, but nothing spectacular.  The chicken fried rice tasted old or stale, my daughter and I had one serving of it and didn't want more (which is unusual for us with fried rice).  Then it tuned worse, we tried the egg drop soup... it was either rotten, or made with rotten eggs - none of us got more than a spoonful down and we were done.

We rode the carousel which was very slow and short and tried to ride the train, but the wait time was nearly 2 hours so we left.  The only part we enjoyed was roasting marshmallows for s'mores even though we could have done this at home for A LOT cheaper.  We had a stroller as well as a wheelchair in our party and it was insanely difficult to get around.

       " 'Wyndham would be doing the traveling public a favor by revoking their license with this establishment. Had an 8 night stay here and it sucked starting with the day I made my reservations.  Called the hotel 5 months early knowing that I had firm plans to be in the Cleveland area.  First person I spoke with suggested that I call back in the morning because the morning Manager would give me a weekly rate.  So I did and was offered a weekly rate but then he refused to reserve my room even though I offered to pay in full.  Said to call back 1 - 2 months before my scheduled arrival. Called back as suggested and now I am being told that they do not offer weekly rates. I was in town for a national USBC Bowling Tournament and every hotel was sold out since I waited.  Now I am stuck paying the current rate of $430 instead of the $180 that I was quoted.  I mentioned the name of the person that I spoke with previously and now they are playing dumb. Fast forward to check-in and now I find out that each nightly stay was based on a VARIABLE RATE.  Too tired to argue after a 5 hour drive and stuck with no other hotel options. I thought that would be the worst possible experience but boy was I wrong.  Housekeeping was a hit or miss.  Only 2 nights did I return to my room where the bed was made.  3 nights I had to go hunt down clean towels; 2 nights I had to hunt down someone to remove the garbage from my room;  the room was only vacuumed TWICE IN 8 NIGHTS; on one day garbage lined both sides of the hallway for over 4 hours until I mentioned it to housekeeping who happened to step off the elevator as I was headed downstairs to get the missing towels, she was very apologetic and quickly vacuumed my room, removed the garbage and provided me with clean towels.  This was around 4PM when most other hotels would have been done. It does not appear as if anyone cleaned the bathroom the entire stay.  There were toilet stains under the seat and around the toilet bowl.  Seems as if housekeeping was more concerned with collecting soiled towels because it was obvious that they were not prepared to handle a full capacity house.  There was a time I felt that my towels were refolded because the big yellow stain made it quite obvious. The sliding window to my room would not close all the way.  There were TWO DEFECTIVE ELECTRICAL OUTLETS in my room because I could hear the electrical arc if I moved the bed the wrong way.  Told all this to the night Manager and was told that she would contact everyone involved.  Guess what???  NO ONE HAS SPOKEN WITH ME YET!!! The lobby and hallway smelled because of the lack of air conditioning.  The only air movement was from the wind through the open hallway windows.  The lobby smelled of burnt towels because the laundry room was behind the reception desk.  The free breakfast offered was for toast; waffles; cereal or oatmeal. The outside of this \"hotel\" sucked because the sign was hard to see and if you were lucky to see it, then you had to look for a driveway because both sides of the curb lacked any decent lighting or markings.  Night driving made it worse.  Landscaping including weed removal wouldn\\'t help the visual effects.  The long \"buckled\" driveway  with the gaping hole by the sewer grate was huge.  The parking lot was not any better, resealing the blacktop to give it a refreshed look wouldn\\'t hurt. At least Richfield is a safe area to be in according to the online crime data.

       " '**DO NOT DELIVER YOUR BABY HERE** This review is for the L&D and Postpartum Departments.  Do not be fooled by the beautiful delivery rooms like I was. During my intake L&D Nurse Danielle told me that upon delivery, my newborn would be taken straight from me and put in the NICU for monitoring. I was very surprised to hear this and when I tried to explain that my OB mentioned nothing of the sort, she copped an attitude and told me she wouldn\"t discuss it any further. Naturally, I became extremely distraught and remained that way for my entire 36 hour labor. Delivering a baby is stressful enough and the nurses are supposed to help you not add to the stress. Out of the 5 different nurses I had in L&D, there was only one nurse who wasn\\'t horribly rude. Nurse Roberta. It was her first delivery working at a new hospital. Although I suspect her kindness had something to do with being new, I am thankful for it nonetheless.  My beautiful baby was born PERFECT and (surprise!) ends up staying with us the entire time in the recovery room. I was excited to be transferred to the Postpartum Unit so I could relax with my new family and hopefully get some peace. Nope. The nurses were even worse. Even months later, I still get so upset just thinking about how rude everyone was. It was the happiest days of my life but there is a huge dark cloud hanging over those memories and that hurts my heart. My husband and I are both educated, successful adults and we were treated like crackheads that deserved to get their baby taken away. Nurse Lisa was the absolute worst. I literally cried the few times she was our nurse. I understand that this hospital isn\\'t in the best neighborhood and I can\\'t imagine some of the things that these nurses have seen BUT they can\\'t treat everyone like criminals. My baby and I were drug tested 5 different times. Which is fine, of course, do what you have to do. BUT DO NOT, come waltzing into my room after the last one and exclaim \"Guess what your test came back negative!!!\" My husband looked at Nurse Lisa and told her that it wasn\\'t a surprise. Before that incident, I was in the middle of asking her if she was going to check the baby\"s Blilirubin saying \"Are you guys going to....\" Nurse Lisa cut me off saying, \"What? Call CPS?\" We were like what are you saying? Again, educated, succesful adults. No absolute reason to treat us like that. Maybe it was because of the type of insurance I had but even that is no excuse.  My husband and I ended up running out of the small amount of generic baby wipes the hospital gave us. When we informed Nurse Lisa that we were out of wipes she instructed us to clean up our baby\\'s meconium up with PAPER TOWELS.  If you or someone you know if thinking about delivering here, please think twice! Don\\'t let this hospital ruin what is supposed to be the most sacred and amazing time of your lives. If for some strange reason you must have your baby here request a different nurse instead of Nurse Danielle and/or Nurse Lisa. Edited to add: As a result of my experience at Phoenix Baptist, I developed PTSD and had extreme anxiety attacks from the moment I found out I was pregnant with my second, to the moment I left the hospital with a baby in my arms.',\n",

I called and a guy answered the phone and he was very nice. He gave me an estimate on the price and I agreed to it. I asked for someone to be at my house at 1PM because my dad needed to get to his car repair shop to pick up his car before they closed. I had looked at all the reviews and saw they only had 3 stars and it was actually 2 stars back on that day, but I wanted to give it a try myself because I thought maybe these people just had a bad person who is making the company suffer....NOOOO IT IS THE WHOLE COMPANY...IT STARTS FROM THE HEAD DOWN. Well the time came, it was 1pm and my dad was dressed in his coat, boots, scarf, hat, gloves, etc and ready to go. It became 1:03pm so I called them back and I got the notification no one was even dispatched out to us yet. So I waited 3 more minutes and then called and spoke with someone. It was a woman this time and I told her I specifically told the guy that someone was suppose to be at my house by 1pm. She said no one was dispatched yet and even asked me the time. I told her it was 1:07pm and she said the GUY I had talked to earlier put that no one was suppose to be coming out until 1:06pm...okay well it was still past the time. I would have been understanding because it is winter and it was one of the days where the snow was coming down hard and the streets were pretty bad, IF I HADN'T CALLED TWO and A HALF HOURS before to get someone to my house on time. She apologized and I said if no one got to my house in 20 mins then I would cancel and take my business elsewhere. I waited but decided to call another service, which was a lot more money, just in case they didn't make it. Well, 20 mins later, I called the number again and heard they still hadn't dispatched anyone and so I called and canceled the taxi. It is ridiculous. I understand they were busy that day and the weather was bad but I CALLED 2 1/2 HOURS AHEAD OF TIME...if you couldn't make it then don't tell people you can.

It was more expensive, but it was a flat rate charge and worth every penny.

When I asked about certain songs and their versions he did not want to answer me and responded with a couple F-bombs. This makes me think that he has illegal copies of songs. I hope the owner of this bar understands he is losing good money by the people he employs.  Do not go on nights that Dan Dan the Karaoke host is there. I can't speak for any other nights.\",\n",

       " \"I rarely find myself leaving this Sephora happy or impressed. I was served by two different associates, one of which was a permanent staff member (I know because she was wearing the Sephora dress), and the other was a seasonal. The permanent staff member was surprisingly quite unknowledgeable when it came to shade-matching my skin. She was clueless when it came to using the Color IQ system..  She did not know what to respond when I asked her about this popular foundation. It was quite awkward. The seasonal staff fortunately took over and poorly matched me with the foundation I was interested in. Additionally, I found she was very blunt and judgemental. She did not smile and did not look friendly whatsoever. I honestly didn't feel comfortable nor like I was in good hands. From now on, I'll probably just stick to shopping at the Scarborough Town Centre Sephora location. Their service and product knowledge is far better. It's disappointing as I would expect way better service from Eaton Centre Sephora, especially since it is the flagship store :/\",\n",

       " \"I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch. The servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one! Now for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything). Strike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something! If you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!\",\n",

I will say that after I complained to corporate that they sent me a free meal card which is a nice gesture but I can't bring myself to come back to this location. I stopped by here for dinner mid-week and there were a couple of people in line ahead of me placing their orders. Another 4-5 people came in behind me and there seemed to be no manager around to round up some help for the two, already overwhelmed people managing the line. There were people in the back of the kitchen shouting at each other, the line staff and the cashier, so I'm not sure what purpose they served besides making themselves look foolish. Oh and they have these stupid cheers that they shout whenever someone orders the meat part of their meal.  The guy helping me was friendly but he was obviously stressed, thus sloppy. While he was taking my order, he was trying to change out a tray of some kind of sauce and ended up spilling it all over the lettuce and a couple of other trays of condiments. He had to change his gloves and no one offered to step in and help which I thought was weird. The staff just stood there staring at the line like they weren't sure what to do. When he came back, he rushed me through, got my order wrong (which I didn't realize until I got home). Maybe instead of learning cheers about the different types of meat being ordered, they should focus more on how to run their operation more efficiently. Fortunately when I got my free meal card I was able to take it to the other Tempe location which was significantly better.\",\n",

I expected each of those to be taken. Let's be honest , all women and young girls come to platos to try and find PINK brand items at a lower price ... I had a couple pairs of yoga pants , worn probably one time ... pink shirts with sequins on them..etc and we all know their product isn't cheap. I had two big bags filled and they took four items .. that probably added to be about 300 in total alone that I paid out of pocket. They offered me $13.15 . NEVER again will I take my clothes there to sell . It also amazed me that they didn't take more considering half of what I saw when looking around , was garbage.

Interior seemed nice enough, very open and with large cases full of cupcakes, cake bites, and cookies.  I decided to buy a couple of cupcakes, a few cake bites, and a cookie - try out a variety of items.  When I got home, I looked this place up - out of curiosity - and found out it is actually a chain with the majority of stores in Utah.  This was somewhat disappointing as I prefer the smaller, locally owned shops.   However, the baked good looked tasty, so we gave them a try.  Woooo - WORST cupcakes ever!!!!  The first one we tried was called \"Vanilla Squared\" and appeared to be a vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream frosting.  Wrong - it was actually topped with almond flavored icing - and VERY heavy on the almond!  The almond extract flavor was so intense, my husband had to spit it out and rinse his mouth out!  Why in the world would you call it \"Vanilla Squared\" when you don\\'t even use vanilla to flavor it??  On to the other cupcake - \"Cookies & Cream.\"  A chocolate cupcake with oreo frosting.  We took one bite, and it followed the other one into the garbage.  The cake tasted stale, and not at all like chocolate, and the frosting was just a greasy, tasteless blob!   Still hoping to salvage something from the bunch of goodies, my husband took a bite of the lemon cake bite.  He spit it out, said it tasted like some weird mixture of fake lemon flavoring and ground up almonds.  Just as bad as the rest.  Unfortunately, we will not be going back to this bakery.  Yes, it is cheaper than Sprinkles, which is also not the best in our opinion, but it tastes terrible!  Save your money - you would be better off with something from the grocery store!',\n",

I hoped she really new MMA because her ass was mine. I grabbed her hair and punched her in her face and--- Well...I snapped out of it.

Our salesperson explained that the reason they don't offer options is to keep the pricing down and ensure timely shipping of the furnitre, or some other BS like that...I honestly cannot say for certain what she said because I was in shock, still trying to process the fact that we couldn't actually chose a fabric or configuration to suit my friend's sectional sofa needs.

The porridge was okay - it was actually kind of bland and I wish I had salt. The Wonton soup was not any better - the noodles were stuck together and the wonton was also very bland.  So even after trying the food here and knowing its not that good- why would I come back again? Well my dad didn't think it was so bad so the next day he wanted to order the same thing - I really didn't want to but he insisted he wanted to eat porridge - so this time we went to order it for take out again. This time I experienced the service -- and it was ridiculous - took 45 minutes for two dishes...on top of that the waitress was very unfriendly. The chef didn't even remember to make the porridge until I asked the waitress three times after 30 minutes - and she finally asked the chef - which was just standing around - to make it. It took him less than 5 minutes to make it but I waited 45 minutes for it. Then after that I asked her for an extra spoon and she didn't even want to give it.

The barista than flatly said \"oh, sorry, I handed you the wrong drink,\" and proceeded to give her a different drink.

       " 'For the first time in my entire life, I instructed my party NOT to leave a tip and they reacted by counting out COINS so that we could pay the bill for this would-be meal and ensure that the wait staff was aware that we hadn\\'t forgotten a tip, but simply that they had not earned one from us. We had a party of four meeting up at this location to grab a quick bite before our movie began at 7:00.  Two of us showed up first and were brought to our seats.  An older gentleman came up to our table and asked for our drink orders...and then a younger gentleman came up a minute later for our drink orders.  I informed him that we had already been helped and thanked him.  After a few minutes, our original server brought out our drinks and a basket of tortilla chips with a tray or salsa, bean dip and guacamole to munch on.  This is one of the things I love about Mexican food restaurants, it\\'s their version of a bread basket and it works so well, for me, because I love salsa and chips. After about ten more minutes, another of our party showed up and the same thing happened as before.  Older gentlemen gets her drink order and then the younger one does the same thing.  I\\'m curious, are they really so overstaffed that they need two people to check up on each other or are they just unaware of which sections each is supposed to cover?  No matter, since we were splitting the bill and crunched for time (and our fourth party was stuck in traffic), we order two appetizers to split.   After we ordered, my best friend noticed that our salsa, bean dip and guacamole was almost empty and the older gentleman was at our table so she asked him to send us a new one.  He looked directly at her as she made the request and then just turned around and walked away.  She gave his retreating back a funny look and then noticed that the younger gentleman was about to pass our table and stopped him for the same request.  He got a very nervous looks on his face, shook his head and informed us that this wasn\\'t his section and he\\'d send our server over.  Really?  Then why were you asking for our drink orders and serving the two tables to the left and right of us? The older server came out with his stern face in place and snidely informed my best friend that only the first bowl of salsa and dip is free, afterwards he would have to charge us $7.95.  Just so that everybody is aware, that\\'s the price of an appetizer at this location.  My friend literally laughed at him and waved him away after I had informed him that this would be our once and only visit to this restaurant.  It amazes me that $7.95 is worth the loss of what might have been a repeat customer. After we ate, the older server handed us our bill of $25.30 and my two companions literally counted out 25 dollars and three dimes while I wrote on the note that they should be on the lookout for my upcoming one star yelp review and that the service was so horrible that I would not be back.  Three servers saw that I was writing on the bill and pointed us out in front of the restaurant while they whispered vehemently about us.  To top everything off, the server came and snatched up what we had left before we were even out of the booth and gave us a cold sneer for our \"generosity.\"   It\\'s actually a crying shame that I won\\'t be back to this restaurant, especially in a town like Las Vegas where there can\\'t be that many more Mexican food restaurants that would be willing to bestow decent service on a paying customer...right?',\n",
       " 'I bought a brand new truck in 2014 (2014 tacoma) durring the annual clearance event from this dealership. The sales associate I dealt with was aggressive and misleading the whole experience. I was in need of a truck, but i should have walked away. I traded in my Nissan pathfinder, so I put down the difference to start off without existing balance due. Also, I have great credit. I told my sales associate I wanted to purchase on a five year and I wasn\\'t looking to lease. He insisted I do a lease, but after half a dozen declines from me, he laid off. Of course the vehicle I wanted to purchase was not part of the clearance event, conveniently, so they tried putting me in a tundra instead. At this point I was about to leave, so the sales associate started working his deal. We went from $800 monthly payments down to the $575 (roughly) over several hours. After all the exhausting hours of being swayed and confused we settled on a number. He assured me verbally it was on a 5 year payment plan. Findlay was also offering tires for life and oil changes for the duration of my payments durring this sale. I inquired about this since it sounded to good to be true and I was potentially moving out of state in the next couple years. He assured me I could redeem these services nationwide at any toyota. I had my kid and wife with me, and we were exhausted from being there all day. I agreed to sign at $575, in hopes to leave the dealership as soon as possible. On the drive home, my wife was going through the paperwork. She noticed that I was put on a payment plan for over 6 years. I was clearly swindled, but accepted it since that\\'s what dealerships tend to do to first time buyers. Last week I received a voicemail from a guy named Ron. He said I was a valued customer who was selected for an exclusive offer. He claimed he could put me in a new truck with a much better APR since mine was so high. He assured me he could even get me a lower payment and id leave in a new version of my truck. I needed an oil change last week, so while waiting I checked out the offer. The only vehicle they offered with a lower payment was a used 2011 tundra construction truck with dents and masked cigarette smell. Any new truck would cost \"a little more\". I also found out I was lied to about oil changes and tires for life. I\\'ve been getting serviced at a closer dealership the past two years, since they assured me I could use any Toyota dealership nationwide. This voided all incentives offered by Findlay since I went to Toyota on my side of town. I was supposed to get all services done at this Findlay if I wanted to keep that program valid. This dealership will literally do anything to sell you a car (like in their adds), including dishonest sales tactics and verbal lies. From this experience I\\'ve learned that handshakes and words mean nothing at this dealership. Fine print is all that matters with these shady characters. I highly reccomend any potential buyers don\\'t sign any paperwork before they physically show you the numbers on the paper. Have your sales associate show you pamphlets or physical paperwork with the incentive they offer.',\n",

Then, the front desk guy tells me they don\\'t have time to do my car today and would need to schedule it at another time.

       " \"I had purchased a Leer camper shell off Craigslist and it didn't match the color of my truck. I called Tom's Camperland and they said they would paint it for $400, and considering they were an authorized Leer dealer, I felt comfortable going with them.  When I dropped the shell off, the man I was dealing with said there was no way they could do it for $400, however, if that's what we were quoted, they would have to honor it.  When it came time to pay, he added on a $75 handling fee, which was never previously discussed (almost as if they were trying to make up for the low quote I was given).  When I called originally to get the quote, I asked where they had their paint jobs done, the man beat around the bush and just said a local body shop.  When I went to pick up the cap, I saw a Maaco truck dropping off all of the caps.  Boy, let me tell you, it was definitely a Maaco paint job.  There was chipping around all emblems and lights, the clear coat was missing in some areas, and the worst of it all, they never opened the windows to paint behind them.  So, when I opened my windows, the original paint color stuck out like a sore thumb.  I took it back up there to have them correct it, and even after the second paint job, I'm still unhappy.  Another issue we had with them...I ordered keys, a locking harness, and a few other items for the shell the same day we dropped it off the first time.  It took over 7 weeks for the keys to come in, and when I went to pick it up, the key didn't fit.  The guy told me that I would have to buy a new lock assembly, and that this sometimes just happens.  He told me would look into it and call me.  This didn't make sense to me, so I started calling around, and I actually called a Leer distributor in CA, and they told me that Tom's Camperland ordered the wrong key to begin with.  When I called Tom's back to tell them this, once again, he said he would look into it, and called me two days later with the correct key.  If I hadn't have done my own research, I would have been stuck with a $100+ part that was unnecessary to begin with.  Needless to say, after 7 different trips up there, at 12 miles/gallon, I never received as much as an apology let alone any compensation.  Every time I called there, the man I dealt with seemed annoyed to hear from me, like I was inconveniencing him for HIS errors.  To top it all off, I NEVER received a call anytime my parts were in or my cap was finished, I always had to call THEM to check on the status.  Their customer service stinks!  I'm not at all a complainer, but I've never had such a bad experience with any company. If I wanted a Maaco paint job, I would have called Maaco.\",\n",

And waiting in lines when its 100 degrees out when you don't have to is stupid. The tequila tent was great (once I finally got in). Biggest problem was with the lack of communication. The tent closed at 5pm apparently, which was never stated or told to ticket holders. And vendors just closed up early. Don Julio's table was the best. They paired there tequila with fruit chasers. The tacos and beer were good. The free t-shirts were sweet. I like that it was at the waterfront but the location sucked.

       " 'It was a pain to step into our garage one evening and see the mini lake that had formed around our water heater.  It hurt even more pulling out my wallet at Lowes to shell out hundreds of dollars for a new one. I thought that maybe our luck was changing when the plumbing company that the store uses called me the very next day to set up installation for that evening.  It was just proof that all bad things happen in 3\\'s.  The contractor arrived that evening as promised and our new water heater was installed in a flash.  He was courteous and professional and about what you would want from a serviceman, even cleaning up his mess in the garage after the job was done.  That evening before my wife and I went to bed she opened up the door separating the house from the garage to make sure the lights were off and told me she thought she smelled gas.  I checked it myself and although there was a faint smell we decided that maybe it still lingered from a few hours earlier when our new appliance was installed. After opening the garage door and letting it air out we closed everything up and turned in for the night.  A couple of hours later we decided to check on it again and the smell was back, guaranteeing we had a leak. I shut the gas off until I could call the plumber to come back out the following morning and went back to bed.  The next morning after calling the company about the leak, he was there within 2 hours and tightened everything up.  No smell, No cold water, No problem, right? Wrong. If our only issue was with a small leak during installation this review would be over and they would be getting 4 out of 5 stars.  The issue we have is with how long it took to get us our permit so we could have it inspected.   Building permits are normally obtained before work is started (hence the name \"permit\" meaning permitting the work to be done), but most small jobs, for example putting in a water heater, are done first and then the permit is applied for after the fact. I\\'m fine with that and would have been fine with the week to 2 weeks I was told it was going to take the contractor to pull the permit and mail it to me. 2 weeks went by and I received nothing.  A phone call told me it would be sent later the same week.  Another 2 weeks went by and I called again.  I was told they have been super busy and they would get it out the beginning of the following week. Over 2 weeks later I called Lowes and complained.  They said they would call him and call me back.  When they returned my call they said that he told them that my permit was in the mail and that he was dropping off a copy to the store later that day.  I received my permit in the mail on February 3rd. The following Tuesday I called the contractor to schedule the inspection and according to him we were all set up for2 days later. Knowing the 2 month history we\\'ve had with the plumber I decided to call and verify our appointment on Thursday afternoon. \"I\\'m sorry,\" He tells me on the phone. \"My girl in the office must have forgot to set it up, how is tomorrow for you?\"  How is the fact that I\\'ve just wasted the day waiting around the house when this all should have been taken care of almost 2 months ago?

You'll never get a true answer when asking about the conditions or speed of play. Take today for example, I ask if it's stacked up? They tell me know it isn't.

I was thinking he would be understanding and provide a rain check. Nope, instead he offers to refund half of the green fee. Wow...chicken one day and feathers the next! Don't trust the photos for the conditions of the golf course. I should have taken some to post, but all you really need to do is imagine the mojave desert. So with that said...I suggest if you're considering playing golf to try a few other golf courses that have impeccable service through and through.

If I wanted to go pick it up -- expedited that would be another $18.95..  Why should I have to pay them for their error.  So obviously customer service is also not their strong suite either.

When we first went in we were very happy with the cut. Now it started to seem like each time got worse and worse. Hat has been really choppy on our shih-tzu the last few times. Well we called yesterday to see about taking \"Sofi\" in for a cut but my wife and I own a business so we were going to be a little busy yesterday so we wouldn\\'t be able to pick her up right away but Amy just kept saying \"no it\\'s okay just bring her in! It\\'s no problem!\" So...we did. We dropped her off about 11 o\\'clock and we got a call (while we were in Santan Valley at a job) about 1pm from Amy saying she was ready. We told her we were still working and as soon as we finish at this job we will head over to pick her up. Amy said \"Ok no problem\". So we are finishing up at the job around 2:30-2:45 when Amy called again and in a VERY rude tone tells my wife \"I was calling to see if you were going to come get your dog?\" My wife tells her \"yes we are just getting done here so we are headed to you.\" Remember we are in Santan Valley so it\\'s at least an hour away and it was about to be rush hour. So we get to the shop and grab Sofi and she is shaking sooooo bad and trembling! Now normally she does shake a little but calms down within an hour or so. Well this time she just wouldn\\'t stop shaking and we were a little bit concerned. So we get home we Set her down and Sofi runs right to her kennel. Sophie never runs to her kennel. She is always wanting to play and run around with the kids. Well eventually she comes out of the kennel and my wife notices that there is blood all over the tile floor all over the carpet and so she checks Sofi out and finds that her paw is covered in blood! After further inspection we see that her nail is hacked off so low that they cut the kwik and she is just dripping so much blood! Well I was furious because the least they could have done was TELL US what happened when we picked her up. I know it happens and it would have sat a whole lot better if she would have just told us! It is now 24 hours later and Sofi has not eaten,drank water or even come out of her cage AT ALL! It is breaking our hearts to see her like this. On top of this hair is so choppy it\\'s embarrassing. I would have never let her leave like that if I owned the shop! So we call her today and immediately Amy blames it on us. No \"I\\'m sorry\" or \"Oh no! Is she ok??\" All she can say is \"oh my groomer never said anything and maybe she\\'s shaking because you left her here so long.\" What!?!? Are you nuts lady!? I am beyond pissed and will not only NEVER bring our dogs there but I will encourage everyone I know in our Doggy meets to NEVER use them again. You should be ashamed of yourself Amy. You were rude as all get out to me when I dropped her off too. Horrible way to run a business! If it wasn\\'t for your customers you wouldn\\'t have a business. I know that seems like common sense but I guess it\\'s not for Amy. Sad...very sad.
